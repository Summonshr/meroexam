<h3>Trapezoid</h3>
$A = \frac{a+b}{2}h$ 
where $a$ and $b$ are parallel sides and $h$ is the height

**Law of exponents**
$x^0=1$
$x^{-1}=\frac{1}{x}$, $x^{-2}=\frac{1}{x^2}$
${x^a}{x^b}=x^{a+b}$
$\frac{x^a}{x^b}=x^{a-b}=\frac{1}{x^{b-a}}$
${x^a}{y^a}=(xy)^a$
$(\frac{x}{y})^a=\frac{x^a}{y^a}$
$(x^a)^b=x^{ab}$

**Laws of Square Roots**
$√{a^2}=a$
$√a√b=√{ab}$
$\frac{√a}{√b}=√\frac{a}{b}$

**Laws of Even and Odd Numbers**
even + even = even
odd + odd = even
even + odd = odd
even * even = even
odd * odd = odd
even * odd = even

**Distance**
$D=rt$

**Slope of a Line**
$y=mx+b$
$m=\frac{y2−y1}{x2−x1}$
$slope=\frac{rise}{run}$
**A line increasing as it moves left to right has a positive slope, whereas a decreasing line has a negative slope. A completely horizontal line has a slope of 0.**
