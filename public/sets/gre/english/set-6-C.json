{"parent":["The article “Shock therapy for mental patients will be reviewed”\ncontinues the ignorant tradition of demonizing electroconvulsive\ntherapy (ECT) in the media (the very use of the anachronistic\nand misleading phrase “shock therapy” is unwarranted) without\n5 presenting the compelling reasons for its continued use. Most\nof the facts and quotations in the article, including the\ngratuitous final paragraph about pigs in an abattoir, are\nsimply taken from an article by Davar in “Issues in Medical\nEthics”, without questioning whether Davar’s presentation of\n10 the issue is an unbiased and scientifically accurate one. What\nMs. Davar, and by extension Ms. Jain, has done is simply cite\nauthorities who agree with her point of view, quote statistics\nwithout context, use an abundance of negative adjectives, and\nignore outright the empirically proven benefits (often\n15 life-saving) of ECT in many categories of mentally-ill\npatients. This is shabby and irresponsible medical journalism.\nWhile this is not the place to dispute, point-by-point, Ms.\nDavar’s presentation of her position and Ms. Jain’s repetition\nof it, I would like to quote, to counter their negative\n20 emphasis, from Andrew Solomon’s widely read, intensively\nresearched, highly respected book, The Noonday Demon: An\nAnatomy of Depression. Solomon writes: “Antidepressants\nare effective [against major depression] about 50 percent of\nthe time, perhaps a bit more; ECT seems to have some\n25 significant impact between 75 and 90 percent of the time...\nMany patients feel substantially better within a few days\nof having an ECT treatment – a boon particularly striking\nin contrast to the long, slow process of medication response.\nECT is particularly appropriate for the severely suicidal –\n30 for patients who repeatedly injure themselves and whose\nsituation is therefore mortally urgent – because of its\nrapid action and high response rate, and it is used in\npregnant women, the sick, and the elderly, because it does\nnot have the systemic side effects or drug-interaction\n35 problems of most medications.”\nThere are, indeed, problems with the administration of ECT,\nespecially in a country like India with its poor health\ninfrastructure. It would be foolish to deny that the\npractice is subject to abuse (as Solomon and numerous\n40 Indian writers report). The continued use of “direct” ECT\n(without the use of an anesthetic) is certainly a matter\nof concern – and a concerted effort to implement national\nguidelines making “modified” ECT (using an anesthetic)\nmandatory is as necessary as it is laudatory. But we can\n45 all do without more pieces of journalism which perpetuate\nthe myth that ECT is a medically unjustified, indeed barbaric\npractice, tantamount to torture. This ignorant view, equally\nprevalent in the West as it is in India, has more to do with\nmovies like One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest than\n50 with scientific fact.","It is exceedingly difficult to make people realize that an evil\nis an evil. For instance, we seize a man and deliberately do\nhim a malicious injury: say, imprison him for years. One would\nnot suppose that it needed any exceptional clearness of wit to\n5 recognize in this an act of diabolical cruelty. But in England\nsuch a recognition provokes a stare of surprise, followed by an\nexplanation that the outrage is punishment or justice or\nsomething else that is all right, or perhaps by a heated attempt\nto argue that we should all be robbed and murdered in our beds\n10 if such senseless villainies as sentences of imprisonment were\nnot committed daily. It is useless to argue that even if this\nwere true, which it is not, the alternative to adding crimes\nof our own to the crimes from which we suffer is not helpless\nsubmission. Chickenpox is an evil; but if I were to declare\n15 that we must either submit to it or else repress it by seizing\neveryone who suffers from it and punishing them by inoculation\nwith smallpox, I should be laughed at; for though nobody could\ndeny that the result would be to prevent chickenpox to some\nextent by making people avoid it much more carefully, and to\n20 effect a further apparent prevention by making them conceal\nit very anxiously, yet people would have sense enough to see\nthat the deliberate propagation of smallpox was a creation of\nevil, and must therefore be ruled out in favor of purely humane\nand hygienic measures. Yet in the precisely parallel case of a\n25 man breaking into my house and stealing my diamonds I am\nexpected as a matter of course to steal ten years of his life.\nIf he tries to defeat that monstrous retaliation by shooting\nme, my survivors hang him. The net result suggested by the\npolice statistics is that we inflict atrocious injuries on the\n30 burglars we catch in order to make the rest take effectual\nprecautions against detection; so that instead of saving our\ndiamonds from burglary we only greatly decrease our chances\nof ever getting them back, and increase our chances of being\nshot by the robber.\n35 But the thoughtless wickedness with which we scatter\nsentences of imprisonment is as nothing compared to the\nstupid levity with which we tolerate poverty as if it were\neither a wholesome tonic for lazy people or else a virtue to\nbe embraced as St. Francis embraced it. If a man is indolent,\n40 let him be poor. If he is drunken, let him be poor. If he is\nnot a gentleman, let him be poor. If he is addicted to the\nfine arts or to pure science instead of to trade and finance,\nlet him be poor. If he chooses to spend his wages on his beer\nand his family instead of saving it up for his old age, let\n45 him be poor. Let nothing be done for \"the undeserving\": let\nhim be poor. Serve him right! Also -- somewhat inconsistently\n-- blessed are the poor!","Early data on seat-belt use showed that seat-belt wearers were less likely to be killed in road accidents.\nHence, it was initially believed that wearing a seat-belt increased survival chances in an accident.
