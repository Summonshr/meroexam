The consequences of this neglect of\nwww.theallpapers.com\nGRE 最新练习题二\n35\ntraditional scholarship are particularly unfortunate for the\n(5) study of women writers. If the canon—the list of authors\nwhose works are most widely taught—is ever to include\nmore women, scholars must be well trained in historical\nscholarship and textual editing. Scholars who do not know\nhow to read early manuscripts, locate rare books, establish\n(10)a sequence of editions, and so on are bereft of crucial tools\nfor revising the canon.\n To address such concerns, an experimental version of\nthe traditional scholarly methods course was designed to\nraise students' consciousness about the usefulness of\n(15)traditional learning for any modern critic or theorist. To\nminimize the artificial aspects of the conventional course,\nthe usual procedure of assigning a large number of small\nproblems drawn from the entire range of historical periods\nwas abandoned, though this procedure has the obvious\n(20)advantage of at least superficially familiarizing students\nwith a wide range of reference sources. Instead students\nwere engaged in a collective effort to do original work on\na neglected eighteenth-century writer, Elizabeth Griffith, to\ngive them an authentic experience of literary scholarship\n(25)and to inspire them to take responsibility for the quality of\ntheir own work.\n Griffith's work presented a number of advantages for\nthis particular pedagogical purpose. First, the body of\nextant scholarship on Griffith was so tiny that it could all\n(30)be read in a day; thus students spent little time and effort\nmastering the literature and had a clear field for their own\ndiscoveries. Griffith's play The Platonic Wife exists in three\nversions, enough to provide illustrations of editorial issues\nbut not too many for beginning students to manage. In addi-\n(35)tion, because Griffith was successful in the eighteenth century, as her continued productivity and favorable reviews\ndemonstrate, her exclusion from the canon and virtual disappearance from literary history also helped raise issues\nconcerning the current canon.\n(40) The range of Griffith's work meant that each student\ncould become the world's leading authority on a particular\nGriffith text. For example, a student studying Griffith's\nWife in the Rightobtained a first edition of the play and\nstudied it for some weeks. This student was suitably\n(45)shocked and outraged to find its title transformed into A\nWife in the Night in Watt'sBibliotheca Britannica. Such\nexperiences, inevitable and common in working on a writer\nto whom so little attention has been paid, serve to vaccinate\nthe student ---I hope for a lifetime—against credulous use\nof reference sources.","Experiments show that insects can function as pollinators\nof cycads, rare, palmlike tropical plants.Furthermore, cycads\nremoved from their native habitats—and therefore from\ninsects native to those habitats—are usually infertile. Nev-\n(5) ertheless, anecdotal reports of wind pollination in cycads\ncannot be ignored. The structure of cycads male cones is\nquite consistent with the wind dispersal of pollen, clouds\nof which are released from some of the larger cones. The\nmale cone of Cycas circinalis, for example, sheds almost\n(10)100 cubic centimeters of pollen, most of which is probably\ndispersed by wind. Still, many male cycad cones are comparatively \nsmall and thus produce far less pollen. Furthermore, the structure \nof most female cycad cones seems inconsistent with direct \npollination by wind. Only in the Cycas\n(15)genus are the females' ovules accessible to airborne pollen,\nsince only in this genus are the ovules surrounded by a\nloose aggregation of megasporophylls rather than by a tight\ncone."]}
