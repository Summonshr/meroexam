{"parent":["Influenced by the view of some twentieth-century\nfeminists that women's position within the family is\none of the central factors determining women's social\nposition, some historians have underestimated the signi-\n(5) ficance of the woman suffrage movement. These \nhistorians contend that nineteenth-century suffragism \nwas less\nradical and, hence, less important than, for example, the\nmoral reform movement or domestic feminism—two\nnineteenth-century movements in which women strug-\n(10)gled for more power and autonomy within the family.\nTrue, by emphasizing these struggles, such historians\nhave broadened the conventional view of nineteenthcentury feminism, \nbut they do a historical disservice to\nsuffragism. Nineteenth-century feminists and anti-\n(15)feminist alike perceived the suffragists' demand for\nenfranchisement as the most radical element in women's\nprotest, in part because suffragists were demanding\npower that was not based on the institution of the\nfamily, women's traditional sphere. When evaluating\n(20)nineteenth-century feminism as a social force, \ncontemporary historians should consider the perceptions of\nactual participants in the historical events.","Many objects in daily use have clearly been influenced\nby science, but their form and function, their dimensions\nand appearance, were determined by technologists\nartisans, designers, inventors, and engineers______________using non-\n(5) scientific modes of thought. Many features and qualities\nof the objects that a technologist thinks about cannot be\nreduced to unambiguous verbal descriptions; they are\ndealt with in the mind by a visual, nonverbal process. In\nthe development of Western technology, it has been non-\n(10)verbal thinking, by and large, that has fixed the outlines\nand filled in the details of our material surroundings.\nPyramids, cathedrals, and rockets exist not because of\ngeometry or thermodynamics, but because they were first\na picture in the minds of those who built them.\n(15) The creative shaping process of a technologist's mind\ncan be seen in nearly every artifact that exists. For example, in designing a diesel engine, a technologist might\nimpress individual ways of nonverbal thinking on the\nmachine by continually using an intuitive sense of right-\n(20)ness and fitness. What would be the shape of the combustion chamber? Where should the valves be placed?\nShould it have a long or short piston? Such questions\nhave a range of answers that are supplied by experience,\nby physical requirements, by limitations of available\n(25)space, and not least by a sense of form. Some decisions,\nsuch as wall thickness and pin diameter, may depend on\nscientific calculations, but the nonscientific component\nof design remains primary.\n Design courses, then, should be an essential element\n(30)in engineering curricula. Nonverbal thinking, a central\nmechanism in engineering design, involves perceptions,\nthe stock-in-trade of the artist, not the scientist. Because\nperceptive processes are not assumed to entail \"hard\nthinking,\" nonverbal thought is sometimes seen as a prim-\n(35)itive stage in the development of cognitive processes and\ninferior to verbal or mathematical thought. But it is paradoxical that when the staff of the Historic American\nEngineering Record wished to have drawings made of\nmachines and isometric views of industrial processes for\n(40)its historical record of American engineering, the only\ncollege students with the requisite abilities were not engineering students, but rather students attending architectural schools.\n It courses in design, which in a strongly analytical\n(45)engineering curriculum provide the background required\nfor practical problem- solving, are not provided, we can\nexpect to encounter silly but costly errors occurring in\nadvanced engineering systems. For example, early models\nof high-speed railroad cars loaded with sophisticated\n(50)controls were unable to operate in a snowstorm because\na fan sucked snow into the electrical system. Absurd random failures that plague automatic control systems are\nnot merely trivial aberrations; they are a reflection of the\nchaos that results when design is assumed to be primarily\na problem in mathematics."],"questions":[{"question":"The author asserts that the historians discussed in the passage have","options":[{"key":"A","answer":"influenced feminist theorists who concentrate on the
