            "explanation": "An apostrophe is required in \"who's,\" a contraction of \"who is.\" No apostrophe (A) is incorrect. \"Whose\" (B) is the possessive (i.e. belonging to whom). Its irregular spelling differentiates it from the contraction \"who's\" (like \"its\" vs. \"it's\"). \"Whose\" is never spelled with a final apostrophe (E). \"Who is\" (C) is not incorrect, but expanding the contraction to full form avoids correctly identifying the contraction's correct spelling."
