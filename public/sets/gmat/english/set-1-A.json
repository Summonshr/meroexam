The past perfect \"had been\" [(D), (E)] is inappropriate in this context: simple past \"was ostracized\" refers to the historical event itself. Past perfect would only be used with something identified as leading up to the past event, e.g. \"...who had been refusing to reduce rent for years and finally was ostracized.\""

Present progressive (D) is awkward and suggests the opinion is only current and short-term. \"Has been\" without \"seen\" (E) changes the meaning from public opinion to fact-and past, not present, fact."

Also, past perfect \"had been sold out\" is more correct than simple past tense \"were sold out\" (C) since the selling out preceded when the play came to town (past tense). \"For\" (E) instead of \"far\" in advance is the wrong preposition/word choice for the meaning and makes no sense."
