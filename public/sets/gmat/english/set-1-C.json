The infinitive \"to stay/remain\" [(A)/(B)] disagrees with the gerunds \"eating, drinking.\" Adding \"She liked...\" (D) incorrectly places the third verbal into an independent clause with another subject and verb, contradicting the sentence structure-and redundant with \"were among her pleasures.\" \"Trying to stay up late\" (E) changes the meaning."
