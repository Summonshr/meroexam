## Talkative Words

**Gregarious (adj.)**

If you are sociable, you are talkative, right? Well, not exactly. To be gregarious is to be likely to socialize with others.

A good synonym is flocking, like what birds do. But, just as birds do not talk to one another outside of a Pixar flick, people can hang out with each other and not necessarily have to chat.

Therefore, do not confuse gregarious with garrulous, which means talkative.

> Often we think that great leaders are those who are gregarious, always in the middle of a large group of people; yet, as Mahatma Gandhi and many others have shown us, leaders can often be introverted.

**Ingenuous (adj.)**

You may think you’ve heard someone exclaim, what an ingenuous plan! But, it’s actually an ingenious plan. To be ingenuous is to be naïve and innocent.

So, if you are likely to go along with a devious plan, whether or not it is ingenious, you are ingenuous.

> Two-years in college in Manhattan had changed Jenna from an ingenuous girl from the suburbs to a jaded urbanite, unlikely to fall for any ruse, regardless of how elaborate.

**Peruse (v.)**

Peruse means to read very carefully. Unfortunately, the colloquial usage not only ignores this definition, but goes so far as to flip this definition on its head.

In light conversatoin, peruse means to read over quickly. The GRE constitutes anything but light conversation, so make sure to remember that peruse means to read over carefully (perusing the first part of this paragraph helps!).

> Instead of perusing important documents, people all too often rush to the bottom of the page and plaster their signature at the bottom.

**Disabuse (v.)**

To disabuse is not the opposite of abuse (which would be a strange word to have an opposite for in the first place). To disabuse is to persuade somebody that his/her belief is not valid.

Often, disabuse goes together with the word notion:

> As a child, I was quickly disabused of the notion that Santa Claus was a rotund benefactor of infinite largess—one night I saw my mother diligently wrapping presents and storing them under our Christmas tree.

**Mettlesome (adj.)**

When you poke your nose in somebody else’s business, you are being meddlesome. If you are mettlesome, on the other hand, you are filled with mettle (no, not the hard stuff).

Mettle means courage or valor. A soldier on the battlefield is mettlesome when he runs into enemy fire to save a comrade.

> For its raid on the Bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Seal Team Six has become, for many Americans, the embodiment of mettle.
