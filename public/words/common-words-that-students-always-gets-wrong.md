## Common Words that Students Always Get Wrong

**Extant (adj.)**

Many think this word means extinct. Extant is actually the opposite of extinct.

A great mnemonic is to put the word ‘is’ between the ‘x’ and the ‘t’ in extant. This gives you existant (don’t mind the misspelling).

> Despite many bookstores closing, experts predict that some form of book dealing will still be extant  generations from now.

**Contentious (adj.)**

This GRE word does not mean content, as in feeling happy. It comes from the word contend, which means to argue. If you are contentious, you like to argue.

Contentious is a very common GRE word, so unless you want me to become contentious, memorize it now!

> Since old grandpa Harry became very contentious during the summer when only reruns were on T.V., the grandkids learned to hide from him at every opportunity.

**Auspicious (adj.)**

This word sounds very sinister, but actually means the opposite of sinister. If an occasion is auspicious, it is favorable.

The opposite, inauspicious, is also common on the GRE. It means unfavorable.

> Despite an auspicious beginning, Mike’s road trip became a series of mishaps, and he was soon stranded and penniless, leaning against his wrecked automobile.

**Enervate (v.)**

Most people think enervate means to energize. It actually means to sap the energy from.

> John preferred to avoid equatorial countries; the intense sun would always leave him enervated after he’d spent the day sightseeing.

**Equivocate (v.)**

People tend to think that equivocate has to do with equal. It actually means to speak vaguely, usually with the intention to mislead or deceive.

More generally, equivocal can mean ambiguous. The related word unequivocal can also be confusing.

To state something unequivocally is to state it in such a way that there is no room for doubt.

> The findings of the study were equivocal—the two researchers had divergent opinions on what the results signified.

**Ambivalent (adj.)**

Students often believe that to be ambivalent towards something is to be indifferent. The truth is almost the opposite.

See, when you are ambivalent you have mixed or conflicting emotions about something.

Imagine somebody asked you what it was like studying for the GRE.

> Sam was ambivalent about studying for the GRE because it ate up a lot of her time, yet he learned many words and improved at reading comprehension.

**Sedulous (adj.)**

I am not quite sure why students can never seem to remember the definition of this word. Perhaps the sed- reminds them of sitting and being idle (like in sedentary).

To be sedulous, however, is to be anything but idle. If you are sedulously studying for the GRE, you are studying diligently and carefully—making flashcards, writing down important words and formulas, and, of course, checking out the Meroexam.com Website every day.

> An avid numismatist, Harold sedulously amassed a collection of coins from over 100 countries—an endeavor that took over fifteen years, and to five continents.
