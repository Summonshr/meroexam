## Difficult Words that the GRE Loves to Use

**Belie (v.)**

This is ETS’s number one favorite word for harder questions. Period. If ETS needs to make a Text Completion or Sentence Equivalence questions difficult, all it needs to do is throw in belie. The key to answering a text completion question that uses belie is to know how the word functions in context. Let’s take a look below:

Her surface calm belied her roiling emotions.

The effortless fluidity with which the pianist’s fingers moved belied the countless hours he had practiced.

Her upbeat attitude during the group project belied her inherent pessimism towards any collective endeavor.

> In each case, note how the outward appearance does not match up with the reality. That contradiction is the essence of belie.

**Disinterested (adj.)**

Much as the addition of belie is a difficult vocabulary word that tends to make a question harder, the addition of disinterested into a text completion can make it a difficult question.

Why?

Everybody assumes that disinterested means not interested. While this is acceptable colloquially, the GRE, as you’ve probably come to learn by now, is anything but colloquial. The definition of disinterested is unbiased, neutral.

> The potential juror knew the defendant, and therefore could not serve on the jury, which must consist only of disinterested members.

**Equivocal (adj.)**

Equivocal does not mean equal. It means vague, undecided.

Equivocal, especially in its more common form equivocate, has a negative connotation.

If a politician is equivocating, he/she is not answering a question directly, but is beating around the bush.

In the academic GRE sense, if a phenomenon is open to multiple interpretations it is equivocal.

> Whether we can glean an artist’s unconscious urges through his or her art remains equivocal – that we can ever even really tap into another person’s hidden motives remains in doubt.

**Undermine (v.)**

Undermine is common in all sections of the GRE, not just difficult sections. It can pop up in reading comprehension answer choices just as commonly as text completion questions.

Undermine means to weaken and is usually paired with an abstract term, such as authority. It can also have the connotation of slowly or insidiously eroding (insidious mean subtly harmful).

> The student undermined the teacher’s authority by questioning the teacher’s judgment on numerous occasions.

**Sententious (adj.)**

This word looks like it would relate to a sentence.

If you know the GRE, you will know this is probably not the case, as the GRE is likely to subvert people’s gut reactions.

Sententious means to be moralizing, usually in a pompous sense.

> The old man, casting his nose up in the air at the group of adolescents, intoned sententiously, “Youth is wasted on the young.”

**Propitiate (v.)**

Want to make an angry person less angry? Well, then you  attempt to placate or appease. Or, if you like really big GRE words, you propitiate them.

> The two sons, plying their angry father with cheesy neckties for Christmas, were hardly able to propitiate him – the father already had a drawer full of ones he had never worn before or ever planned to.

**Feckless (adj.)**

Feck, probably for its phonetic similarity to another word, has been dropped from the language.

That or the lexicographers have become feckless, which means that they lacked the drive or initiative to include feck in the dictionary.

Feckless means lazy and irresponsible.

So, don’t get feckless and drop the –less, lest somebody totally misinterprets you. In which case, you’ll have to do a fair amount of propitiating.

> By the way, I’m feckless—I won’t include an example sentence (oops, I just walked into a contradiction).

**Tendentious (adj.)**

If you are likely to espouse a controversial view, you are being tendentious.

A good synonym for tendentious is biased, though if you are biased you aren’t necessarily leaning towards a view that is controversial.

> Because political mudslinging has become a staple of the 24-hour media cycle, most of us, despite proclamations to the contrary, are tendentious on many of today’s pressing issues.

**Limpid (adj.)**

This word does not relate to limp, it relates to clarity in terms of expression. Limpid is typically used to describe writing or music.

> Her limpid prose made even the most recondite subjects accessible to all.

**Betray (v.)**

To betray means to go against one’s country or friends. Right? Well, yes, but not always. Especially on the GRE. To betray means to reveal or make known something, usually unintentionally.

Let’s try a Text Completion question:

As we age, our political leanings tend to become less _______; the once dyed-in-wool
conservative can betray liberal leanings, and the staunch progressive may suddenly embrace
conservative policies.

1. pronounced
1. obscured
1. contrived
1. earnest
1. diplomatic

In this case betray means reveal. As we age our political biases become less obvious/extreme (my own
words). Which word is the closest? (A) pronounced.

**Remiss (adj.)**

Remiss does not mean to miss again. It means to be negligent in one’s duty. For some reason, students of mine have always had difficulty remembering this word.

Sometimes I chide them, “Don’t be remiss as vocabulary scholars by forgetting the word remiss.”

While arguably clever, this admonishment isn’t usually as efficacious as I’d hope it would be. (So don’t be remiss!).

> Remiss in his duty to keep the school functioning efficiently, the principle was relieved of his position after only three months.

**Restive (adj.)**

Restive sounds like rest. It’s actually the opposite, and means restless.
Though most of the ‘re-‘ words are common, restive is definitely the re- word you are most likely to see test day.

It can be used to describe both people and groups of people.

> The crowd grew restive as the comedian’s opening jokes fell flat.

**Repine (v.)**

The verb pine means to yearn for. Like remiss, however, the addition of the prefix re- does not signify again.

To repine means to complain or fret over something. Note: the verb pine can also mean to waste away.

> Standing forlornly by the window, she repined for her lost love.

**Remonstrate (v.)**

You’ve probably guessed already that this does not mean to demonstrate again.

To remonstrate means to make objections while pleading.

> The mothers of the kidnapped victims remonstrated to the rogue government to release their children, claiming that the detention violated human rights.
