## Top 5 Basic GRE Words

**Innocuous (adj.)**

Something innocuous is harmless and doesn’t produce any ill effects. Many germs are innocuous. As are most bug bites. Even television, in small doses, is typically innocuous. Innocuous can also mean inoffensive. An innocuous question is unlikely to upset anyone.

> Everyone found Nancy’s banter innocuous—except for Mike, who felt like she was intentionally picking on him.

**Candid (adj.)**

A straightforward and honest look at something is a candid one. Many great photographers have created enduring work because they turned their respective lens on what is real. Whether these photos are from the Dust Bowl, the Vietnam War, or the Arab Winter, they move us because they reveal how people felt at a certain moment.

A person can also be candid if they are being honest and straightforward with you.

> Even with a perfect stranger, Charles was always candid and would rarely hold anything back.

**Erratic (adj.)**

Unpredictable, often wildly so, erratic is reserved for pretty extreme cases.

The stock market is notoriously erratic, as is sleep, especially if your stocks aren’t doing well.

Erratic can also mean strange and unconventional.

Regardless of which meaning you are employing, you should not be erratic in your GRE prep.

**Bleak (adj.)**

If one has a very depressing take on life, we say that person has a bleak outlook.
