## Tricky “Easy” GRE Words with Multiple Meanings

**Stem (v.)**

To stem means to hold back or limit the flow or growth of something. You can stem bleeding, and you can stem the tide—or at least attempt to do so.

However, do not stem the flow of vocabulary coursing through your brains. Make sure to use GRE words whenever you can.

> To stem the tide of applications, the prestigious Ivy requires that each applicant score at least 330 on the Revised GRE.

**Blinkered (adj.)**

If you blink a lot you are likely to miss something. Indeed, your view would be very limited. Extending this meaning, we get the definition of blinkered: means to have a limited outlook or understanding.

The true etymology of the word actually comes from the blinkers that are put on racing horses to prevent them from becoming distracted.

> In gambling, the addict is easily blinkered by past successes and/or past failures, forgetting that the outcome of any one game is independent of the games that preceded it.

**Check (n./v.)**

To check something is to stop its growth (similar to stem but with more of a focus on growth than flow).

If something is left unchecked, then it grows freely.

> Deserted for six months, the property began to look more like a jungle and less like a residence— weeds grew unchecked in the front yard.

**Checkered (adj.)**

The meaning of checkered is completely unrelated to the meaning of check, so be sure to know the difference between the two. A checkered past is one that is marked by disreputable happenings.

> One by one, the presidential candidates dropped out of the race, their respective checkered pasts from embezzlement to infidelity—sabotaging their campaigns.

**Raft (n.)**

A raft is an inflatable boat. It can also mean a large number of something. I know—it doesn’t really make much sense. But here’s a good mnemonic: imagine a large number of rafts and you have a raft of

> Despite a raft of city ordinances passed by an overzealous council, noise pollution continued unabated in the megalopolis.

**Involved (adj.)**

We are involved in many things, from studying to socializing.

For something to be involved, as far as the GRE is concerned, means it is complicated, and difficult to comprehend.

> The physics lecture became so involved that the undergraduate’s eyes glazed over.

**Retiring (adj.)**

Sure, many dream of the day when they can retire (preferably to some palatial estate with a beachfront view). The second definition does not necessarily apply to most. To be retiring is to be shy, and to be inclined to retract from company.

> Nelson was always the first to leave soirees—rather than mill about with “fashionable” folk, he was retiring, and preferred the solitude of his garret.

**Expansive (adj.)**

The common definition of expansive is extensive, wide-ranging. The lesser known definition is communicative, and prone to talking in a sociable manner.

> After a few sips of cognac, the octogenarian shed his irascible demeanor and became expansive, speaking fondly of the “good old days”.

**Moment (n.)**

A moment is a point in time. We all know that definition. If something is of moment, it is significant and important (think of the word momentous).

> Despite the initial hullabaloo, the play was of no great moment in Hampton’s writing career, and, within a few years, the public quickly forgot his foray into theater arts.

**Base (adj.)**

When the definition of this word came into existence, there were some obvious biases against the lower classes (assuming that lexicographers were not lower class).

It was assumed that those from the base, or the lowest, class were without any moral principles. They were contemptible and ignoble. Hence, we have this second definition of base (the word has since dropped any connotations of lower class).

> She was not so base as to begrudge the beggar the unwanted crumbs from her dinner plate.

**Imbibe (v.)**

Literally, to imbibe is to drink, usually copiously. Figuratively, imbibe can refer to an intake of knowledge or information.

> Plato imbibed Socrates’ teachings to such an extent that he was able to write volumes of work that he directly attributed, sometimes word for word, to Socrates.

**Inundate (v.)**

To inundate is a synonym for to deluge, which means to flood. Figuratively, to be inundated means to be overwhelmed by too many people or things.

> The newsroom was inundated with false reports that only made it more difficult for the newscasters to provide an objective account of the bank robbery.

**Scintillating (adj.)**

If something gives off sparks, such as when photons collide, it is said to scintillate. Figuratively, scintillating describes someone who is brilliant and lively (imagine Einstein’s brain giving off sparks).

> Richard Feynman was renowned for his scintillating lectures—the arcana of quantum physics was made lucid as he wrote animatedly on the chalkboard.

**Benighted (adj.)**

If the sky darkens, and becomes night, it is, unsurprisingly, benighted. However, if a people are benighted (this word is usually reserved for the collective), that group falls in a state of ignorance.

This latter definition is more common.

> Far from being a period of utter benightedness, The Medieval Ages produced some inestimable works of theological speculation.

**Galvanize (v.)**

Need to strengthen steel by giving it a final coat? Or, perhaps you need to motivate somebody? Well, in both cases, you would literally be galvanizing. Figuratively, to galvanize is to excite to action or spur on.

> At mile 23 of his first marathon, Kyle had all but given up, until he noticed his friends and family holding a banner that read, “Go Kyle”; galvanized, he broke into a gallop, finishing the last three miles in less than 20 minutes.

**Hedge (n./v.)**

If you are really into horticulture—which is a fancy word for gardening—you’ll know hedges are shrubs, or small bushes that have been neatly trimmed.

If you know your finance, then you’ve probably heard of hedge funds (where brokers make their money betting against the market).

Hedge can also be used in a verb sense.

> If you hedge your bets, you play safely.

> If you hedge a statement, you limit or qualify that statement.

Finally, hedge can also mean to avoid making a direct statement, as in equivocating.

> When asked why he had decided to buy millions of shares at the very moment the tech companies stock soared, the CEO hedged, mentioning something vague about gut instinct.

**Flush (adj.)**

What word means to turn red (especially in the face), to send down the toilet, to be in abundance, and to drive out of hiding? Yep, it’s flush, which has all four of these totally unrelated definitions.

> The GRE Reading Comprehension passage is flush with difficult words, words that you may have learned only yesterday.

**Fell (adj.)**

Imagine an evil person who cuts down trees, and then falls himself. Well, that image is capturing three different definitions of fell—to cut down a tree, the past tense of fall (we all know that) and evil.

Yes, I know, fell can’t possibly mean evil…but the English language is a wacky one. Fell indeed means terribly evil. Now watch out for that tree!

> For fans of the Harry Potter series, the fell Lord Voldemort, who terrorized poor Harry for seven lengthy installments, has finally been vanquished by the forces of good—unless, that is, JK Rowling decides to come out of retirement.

**Arch (adj.)**

You have arches in architecture, or at a well-known fast-food restaurant. You can arch your back, or a bow. Arches are even a part of your foot.

But, did you know that to be arch is to be deliberately teasing, as in, “he shrugged off her insults because he knew she was only being arch”? Finally, arch- as a root means chief or principal, as in archbishop.

> The baroness was arch, making playful asides to the townspeople; yet because they couldn’t pick up on her dry humor, they thought her supercilious.

**Beg (v.)**

Commonly, when we think of begging, we think of money, or a favor. But, one can also beg a question, and that’s where things start to get complicated. To beg a question can mean to evade a question, invite an obvious question, or, and this is where it starts to get really tricky, to ask a question that in itself makes unwarranted assumptions.

For instance, let’s say you are not really sure if you are going to take the GRE.

If somebody asks you when you are going to take the GRE, then that person is assuming you are going to take the GRE. That is, they are begging the question.

If you avoid giving a direct answer, then you are also begging the question (albeit in a different sense).

Which finally begs the question, how did this whole question begging business get so complicated in the first place?

> By assuming that Charlie was headed to college—which he was not—Maggie begged the question when she asked him to which school he was headed in the Fall.

**Tender (v.)**

Tender is a verb, and it does not mean to behave tenderly.

When you tender something, you offer it up.

For instance, when you tender your resignation, you hand in a piece of paper saying that you are resigning.

> The government was loath to tender more money in the fear that it might set off inflation.

**Intimate (adj./v.)**

Just as tender doesn’t relate to two people in love, neither does intimate, at least in the GRE sense.

The secondary meaning for intimate is to suggest something subtly.

> At first Manfred’s teachers intimated to his parents that he was not suited to skip a grade; when his parents protested, teachers explicitly told them that, notwithstanding the boy’s precocity, he was simply too immature to jump to the 6th grade.

**Wanting (adj.)**

Wanting means lacking. So, if your knowledge of secondary meanings is wanting, this eBook is a perfect place to start learning.

> She did not find her vocabulary wanting, yet there were so many GRE vocabulary words that inevitably she did not know a few.

**Becoming (adj.)**

Another secondary meaning that changes parts of speech, becoming an adjective.

> If something is becoming, it is appropriate, and matches nicely. Her dress was becoming and made her look even more beautiful.

**Start (v.)**

The secondary meaning for start is somewhat similar to the common meaning. To start is to suddenly move or dart in a particular direction. Just think of the word startle.

> All alone in the mansion, Henrietta started when she heard a sound.

**Fleece (v.)**

If you are thinking Mary Had a Little Lamb (…fleece as white as snow), you have been fleeced by a secondary meaning. To fleece is to deceive.

> Many have been fleeced by Internet scams and have never received their money back.

**Telling (adj.)**

If something is telling, it is significant and revealing of another factor. If a person’s alibi has a telling detail, often that one little detail can support—or unravel!—the person’s alibi.

> Her unbecoming dress was very telling when it came to her sense of fashion.

**Wax (n./v.)**

Melting wax will only lead you astray. The secondary meaning for wax is to increase. The opposite of wax is to wane.

Both words are used to describe the moon: a waxing moon becomes larger and larger each night until it becomes a full moon, at which point it becomes small and smaller each night and becomes a waning moon.

> Her enthusiasm for the diva’s new album only waxed with each song; by the end of the album, it was her favorite CD yet.

**Check (n./v.)**

To check is to limit, and it is a word usually used to modify the growth of something.

> When government abuses are not kept in check, that government is likely to become autocratic.

**Qualify (v.)**

This is perhaps the most commonly confused secondary meaning, and one that is very important to
know for the GRE. To qualify is to limit, and is usually used in the context of a statement or an opinion.

> I love San Francisco.

> I love San Francisco, but it is always windy.

The first statement shows my unqualified love for San Francisco. In the second statement I qualify, or limit, my love for San Francisco.

In the context of the GRE, the concept of qualification is usually found in the Reading Comprehension passage.

For example, an author usually expresses qualified approval or some qualified opinion in the passage. As you may have noticed, the authors of reading comprehension passages never feel 100% about something. They always think in a nuanced fashion. Therefore, they are unlikely to be gung-ho or downright contemptuous. That is, they qualify, or limit, their praise/approval/disapproval.
