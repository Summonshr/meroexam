## A-Words

**Amiable (adj.)**

Amiable means friendly. It is very similar to amicable, another common GRE word.

Amicable, however, does not refer to a person the way that amiable does, but rather refers to relationships between
people.

You’ll notice that amicable is, therefore, the opposite of acrimonious (see below).

> Amy’s name was very apt: she was so amiable that she was twice voted class president.

**Affable (adj.)**

Likeable, easy to talk to: affable is similar to amiable.

The differences are subtle, and as far as the GRE is concerned, you can treat them as the same word. Like amiable, this word is great to use to describe people we know.

After all, everyone knows an affable person.

> For all his surface affability, Marco was remarkably glum when he wasn’t around other people.

**Amenable (adj.)**

Amenable means easily persuaded. If someone is cooperative and goes along with the program, so to speak, that person is amenable.

Amenable can also be used in the medical sense: if a disease is amenable to treatment, that disease can be treated.

Even though she did not like bad weather, Shirley was generally amenable and decided to accompany her brother to the picinc.

**Attenuate (v.)**

Attenuate means to weaken (in terms of intensity), to taper off/become thinner. Attenuate can refer to both abstract and tangible things.

Her animosity towards Bob attenuated over the years, and she even went so far as to invite him to her party.

> The stick is attenuated at one end to allow the villagers to forage for ants.

**Animosity (n.)**

Meaning Intense hostility, animosity should be reserved for extreme cases. That is, if you really loathe someone, and that person feels the same way, then you can say animosity exists between the two of you.

A related word, and a synonym, is animus (though animus can also mean motivation, as in impetus).

> The governor’s animosity toward his rival was only inflamed when the latter spread false lies regarding the governor’s first term.

**Anomalous (adj.)**

Anomalous means not normal, out of the ordinary, and is simply the adjective—and scarier looking form of anomaly, which is a noun.

Anomalous can be used in cases to describe something that is not typical, like an unusually cold California spring.

> According to those who do not believe in climate change, the extreme weather over the last five years is simply anomalous—average temps should return to average, they believe.

**Acrimony (n.)**

Acrimony means bitterness and ill will. Don’t forget the adjective form, acrimonious, which describes relationships filled with bitterness and ill will.

> The acrimonious dispute between the president and vice-president sent an unequivocal signal to voters: the health of the current administration was imperiled.

**Aberration (n.)**

A deviation from what is normal or expected: this word is tinged with a negative connotation.

For instance, in psychology there is a subset of behavior known as aberrant behavior. So, basically, if you’re narcissistic, psychotic, or just plain old cuckoo, you are demonstrating aberrant behavior.

> Aberrations in climate have become the norm: rarely a week goes by without some meteorological phenomenon makes headlines.

**Ambiguous (adj.)**

Ambiguous means open to more than one interpretation. Let’s say I have two friends, Bob and Paul.

> If I tell you that he is coming to my house today, then that is ambiguous. Who do I mean? Paul or Bob? 

> The coach told his team, “Move towards that side of the field”; because he did not point, his directions were ambiguous, and the team had no idea to which side he was referring.

**Amorphous (adj.)**

Amorphous means shapeless. Morph- comes from the Latin for shape.

The root a-, as in atypical, means not or without.

Therefore, if something is amorphous, it lacks shape.

> His study plan for the GRE was at best amorphous; he would do questions from random pages in any one of seven test prep books.
