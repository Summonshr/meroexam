## Top 10 GRE Words

**Alacrity (n.)**

The GRE has a predilection for words that don’t really sound like what they mean. Alacrity is no exception. Many think the word has a negative connotation. Alacrity, however, means an eager willingness to do something.

So imagine the first day at a job that you’ve worked really hard to get. How are you going to complete the tasks assigned to you? With alacrity, of course.

An interesting correlation: the more alacritous (adjective form) you are when you’re learning GRE vocabulary, the better you will do.

> The first three weeks at his new job, Mark worked with such alacrity that upper management knew they would be giving him a promotion.

**Prosaic (adj.)**

Prosaic conjures up a beautiful mosaic for some. So if somebody or something is prosaic, it must surely be good.

Once again the GRE confounds expectations. Prosaic means dull and lacking imagination. It can be used to describe plans, life, language, or just about anything inanimate that has become dull (it is not used
to describe people).

A good mnemonic: prose is the opposite of poetry. And where poetry, ideally, bursts force with imagination, prose (think of text-book writing), lacks imagination. Hence, prose-aic.

> Unlike the talented artists in his workshop, Paul had no such bent for the visual medium, so when it was time for him to make a stained glass painting, he ended up with a prosaic mosaic.

**Veracity (n.)**

Veracity sounds a lot like voracity. Whereas many know voracity means full of hunger, whether for food or knowledge (the adjective form voracious is more common), few know veracity. Unfortunately, many confuse the two on the test.
Veracity means truthful. Veracious, the adjective form of veracity, sounds a lot like voracious. So be careful.

> After years of political scandals, the congressman was hardly known for his veracity; yet despite this distrust, he was voted into yet another term.

**Paucity (n.)**

Paucity is a lack of something. In honor of paucity, this entry will have a paucity of words.

> There is a paucity of jobs hiring today that require menial skills, since most jobs have either been automated or outsourced.

**Maintain (v.)**

The second definition of this word—and one the new GRE favors—is to assert. One can maintain their innocence. A scientist can maintain that a recent finding supports her theory. The latter context is the one you’ll encounter on the GRE.

> The scientist maintained that the extinction of dinosaurs was most likely brought about by a drastic change in climate.

**Contrite (adj.)**
Word roots are often misleading. This word does not mean with triteness (con- meaning with). To be contrite is to be remorseful.

> Though he stole his little sister’s licorice stick with malevolent glee, Chucky soon became contrite when his sister wouldn’t stop crying.

**Laconic (adj.)**
Another word that sounds different from what it means. A person is described as laconic when he/she says very few words.

I’m usually reminded of John Wayne, the quintessential cowboy, who, with a gravely intonation, muttered few words at a time. As this allusion betrays my age more than anything else, think of Christian Bale in Batman—the laconic caped crusader.

> While Martha always swooned over the hunky, laconic types in romantic comedies, her boyfriends inevitably were very talkative—and not very hunky.

**Pugnacious (adj.)**

Much like a pug dog, which aggressively yaps at anything near it, a person who is pugnacious likes to aggressively argue about everything.

Verbally combative is another good way to describe pugnacious.

> The comedian told one flat joke after another, and when the audience started booing, he pugnaciously spat back at them, “Hey, you think this is easy – why don’t you buffoons give it a shot?”

**Disparate (adj.)**

If two things are fundamentally different, they are disparate. For instance, verbal skills and math skills are disparate, and as such are usually tested separately—the GRE being no exception.

> With the advent of machines capable of looking inside the brain, fields as disparate as religion and biology have been brought together, as scientists try to understand what happens in the brain when people have a religious experience.

**Egregious (adj.)**
‘Greg’ is the Latin root for flock. At one point, egregious meant standing out of the flock in a positive way. This definition went out of vogue sometime in the 16th century, after which time egregious was used ironically. Thus for the last five hundred years, ‘egregious’ meant standing out in a bad way.

In sports, an egregious foul would be called on a player who slugged another player (not including hockey, of course).

> The dictator’s abuse of human rights was so egregious that many world leaders asked that he be tried in an international court for genocide.
