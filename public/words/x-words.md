## “X” words

**Excoriate (v.)**

To yell at someone is one thing; to excoriate them is a whole other. A martinet of a boss whom you’ve once again upset; a drill sergeant berating a feckless, smirking recruit; now we are closer.

So to criticize really, really harshly is to excoriate. Interestingly, the second definition of the word is to tear one’s skin from his/her body. To verbally excoriate, figuratively speaking, is to rip off a person’s skin.

Entrusted with the prototype to his company’s latest smartphone, Larry, during a late night karaoke bout, let the prototype slip into the hands of a rival company—the next day Larry was excoriated, and then fired.

**Extenuating (adj.)**

Extenuating means making less guilty or more forgivable. The phrase “extenuating circumstances” is common courtroom lingo. Say somebody broke into a drugstore to steal some expensive medication.

Later we learn that medication was for that person’s wife, who was dying of some disease that only the
medication could cure. Most of us, presumably, would be more likely to forgive the man.

Why?

Because of the extenuating factor of his wife’s disease.

The jury was hardly moved by the man’s plea that his loneliness was an extenuating factor in his crime
of dognapping a prized pooch.

**Execrate (v.)**

This word just sounds awful. The good news is the meaning of execrate is consistent with the way it sounds.

To execrate somebody is to curse and hiss at them. For instance a certain American basketball player left his team of many years so he could make more money with another team.
Fans of the original team execrated the player for his perfidy and, what they claim, were his mercenary motives.

Interestingly, the adjective form of execrate is the relatively common GRE word execrable. If something is execrable, it is so awful that it is worthy of our hissing.

Though the new sitcom did decently in the ratings, Nelson railed against the show, saying that it was nothing more than execrable pastiche of tired cliché’s and canned laughter

**Exegesis (n.)**

This word refers to a critical interpretation of a scholarly work.

If you think that definition is intimidating, the adjective form is exegetical.

The Bible is fertile ground for exegesis—over the past five centuries there have been as many interpretations as there are pages in a Gideon.

**Exhort (v.)**

To exhort means to strongly urge on, encourage. The encouragement is for a positive action. So a mentor figure will exhort you to make the most of your life, whereas the miscreant will cajole you into doing something you’ll regret.

Nelson’s parents exhorted him to study medicine, urging him to choose a respectable profession; intransigent, Nelson left home to become a graffiti artist.
