**The way students and scholars interpret the materials they work with in their academic fields
is more a matter of personality than of training. Different interpretations come about when
people with different personalities look at exactly the same objects, facts, data, or events and
see different things.**

The speaker asserts that many laws are ineffective in solving society's problems because
moral behavior cannot be legislated. I agree with this assertion insofar as it relates to
constraints on certain personal freedoms. However, when it comes to the conduct of
businesses, I think that moral behavior not only can but must be legislated for the purpose of
alleviating societal problems.

Morality laws that impinge upon freedom of choice about our personal lives--to control what
we do with and to ourselves--simply do not work in a democratic society. People always find
ways to circumvent such laws, which ultimately give way to more lenient laws that
acknowledge personal freedom of choice. The failed Prohibition experiment of the 1930s is
perhaps the paradigmatic example of this. And we are slowly learning history's lesson, as aptly
demonstrated by the recognition of equal rights for same-sex partners, and current trends
toward legalization of physician-assisted suicide and the medicinal use of marijuana. In short,
history informs us that legislating morality merely for morality's sake simply does not work.

Morality laws impinging on personal freedoms are not made any more useful or effective by
purporting to serve the greater good of society, because on balance their costs far outweigh
their benefits. For instance, those who defend the cfiminalization of drug use cite a variety of
harms that result from widespread addiction: increased incidence of domestic violence,
increased burden on our health-care and social-welfare systems, and diminished productivity
of addicts. However, these defenders overlook the fact that outlawing addictive substances
does not prevent, or even deter, people from obtaining and using them. It only compels users
to resort to theft and even violent means of procuring drugs, adding to the economic costs of
enforcement, prosecution, and punishment. In short, the costs of proscription outweigh the
benefits.

In sharp contrast to personal behavior, the behavior of businesses can and must be
controlled through legislation. Left unfettered, businesses tend to act on behalf of their own
financial interest, not on behalf of the society at large. And when excessive business profits
accrue at the expense of public health and safety, in my view business has behaved immorally.

Examples of large-scale immoral behavior on the part of businesses abound. For example,
although technology makes possible the complete elimination of polluting emissions from
automobiles, auto manufacturers are unwilling to voluntarily make the short-term sacrifices
necessary to accomplish this goal. Tobacco companies have long known about the health
hazards of smoking cigarettes; yet they weigh the costs of defending law suits against the
profit from cigarette sales, and continue to cater to nicotine addicts. And when given the
chance, many manufacturers will exploit underage or underprivileged workers to reduce labor
costs, thereby enhancing profits. In short, only govemment holds the regulatory and
enforcement power to impose the standards needed to ensure moral business behavior.

In sum, whether legislating morality is effective or even appropriate depends on whether the
behavior at issue involves personal freedom or public duty. Legislating personal moral
behavior is neither practicable nor proper in a democratic society. On the other hand,
legislating business morality is necessary to ensure public health and safety.
