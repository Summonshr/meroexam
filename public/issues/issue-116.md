**People are mistaken when they assume that the problems they confront are more complex
and challenging than the problems faced by their predecessors. This illusion is eventually
dispelled with increased knowledge and experience.**


Is any sense that the problems we face are more complex and challenging than those which
our predecessors faced merely an illusion--one that can be dispelled by way of knowledge and
experience? The speaker believes so, although I disagree. In my view, the speaker unfairly
generalizes about the nature of contemporary problems, some of which have no analog from
earlier times and which in some respects are more complex and challenging than any
problems earlier societies ever confronted. Nevertheless, I agree that many of the other
problems we humans face are by their nature enduring ones that have changed little in
complexity and difficulty over the span of human history; and I agree that through experience
and enlightened reflection on human history we grow to realize this fact.

I turn first to my chief point of contention with the statement. The speaker overlooks certain
societal problems unique to today's world, which are complex and challenging in ways unlike
any problems that earlier societies ever faced. Consider three examples. The first involves the
growing scarcity of the world's natural resources. An ever-increasing human population,
together with over-consumption on the part of developed nations and with global
dependencies on finite natural resources, have created uniquely contemporary environmental
problems that are global in impact and therefore pose political and economic challenges
previously unrivaled in complexity.

A second uniquely contemporary problem has to do with the fact that the nations of the world
are growing increasingly interdependent--politically, militarily, and economically.

Interdependency makes for problems that are far more complex than analogous problems for
individual nations during times when they were more insular, more self-sustaining, and more
autonomous.

A third uniquely contemporary problem is an outgrowth of the inexorable advancement of
scientific knowledge, and one that society voluntarily takes up as a challenge. Through
scientific advancements we've already solved innumerable health problems, harnessed
various forms of physical energy, and so forth. The problems left to address are the ones that
are most complex and challenging--for example, slowing the aging process, replacing human
limbs and organs, and colonizing other worlds in the event ours becomes inhabitable. In short,
as we solve each successive scientific puzzle we move on to more challenging and complex
ones.

I turn next to my points of agreement with the statement. Humans face certain universal and
timeless problems, which are neither more nor less complex and challenging for any
generation than for preceding ones. These sorts of problems are the ones that spring from the
failings and foibles that are part-and-parcel of human nature. Our problems involving
interpersonal relationships with people of the opposite sex stem from basic differences
between the two sexes. The social problems of prejudice and discrimination know no
chronological bounds because it is our nature to fear and mistrust people who are different
from us. War and crime stem from the male aggressive instinct and innate desire for power.

We've never been able to solve social problems such as homelessness and hunger because
we are driven by self-interest.

I agree with the statement also in that certain kinds of intellectual struggles-- to deter mine
the meaning of life, whether God exists, and so forth are timeless ones whose complexities
and mystery know no chronological bounds whatsoever. The fact that we rely on ancient
teachings to try to solve these problems underscores the fact that these problems have not
grown any more complex over the course of human history. And, with respect to all the
timeless problems mentioned above I agree that knowledge and experience hdp us to
understand that these problems are not more complex today than before. In the final analysis,
by studying history, human psychology, theology, and philosophy we come to realize that,
aside from certain uniquely contemporary problems, we face the same fundamental problems
as our predecessors because we face the same human condition as our predecessors
whenever we look in the mirror.
