**In order to improve the quality of instruction at the college and university level, all faculty
should be required to spend time working outside the academic world in professions relevant
to the courses they teach.**

Whether college faculty should also work outside academia, in professional work related to
their academic fields, depends primarily on the specific academic area. With respect to fields
in which outside work is appropriate, I strongly agree with the statement; students and faculty
all stand to gain in a variety of respects when a professor complements academic duties with
real-world experience.

As a threshold matter, the statement requires qualification in two respects. First, in certain
academic areas there is no profession to speak of outside academia. This is especially true in
the humanities; after all, what work outside academia is there for professors of literature or
philosophy? Secondly, the statement fails to consider that in certain other academic areas a
professor's academic duties typically involve practical work of the sort that occurs outside
academia. This is especially true in the fine and performing arts, where faculty actively engage
in the craft by demonstrating techniques and styles for their students.

Aside from these two qualifications, I strongly agree that it is worthwhile for college faculty to
work outside academia in professional positions related to their field. There are three dear
benefits of doing so. First, in my experience as a student, faculty who are actively engaged in
their fields come to class with fresh insights and a contagious excitement about the subject at
hand. Moreover, they bring to their students practical, real-world examples of the principles
and theories discussed in textbooks, thereby sparking interest, and even motivating some
students to pursue the field as a career.

Secondly, by keeping abreast with the changing demands of work as a professional,
professors can help students who are serious about pursuing a career in that field to make
more informed career decisions. The professor with field experience is better able to impart
useful, up-to-date information about what work in the field entails, and even about the current
job market. After all, college career-planning staff are neither equipped nor sufficiently
experienced to provide such specific advice to students.

A third benefit has to do with faculty research and publication in their areas of specialty.

Experience in the field can help a professor ferret out cutting-edge and controversial
issues--which might be appropriate subjects for research and publication. Moreover, practical
experience can boost a professor's credibility as an expert in the field. For example, each year
a certain sociology professor at my college combined teaching with undercover work
investigating various cults. Not only did the students benefit from the many interesting stories
this professor had to tell about his experiences, the professor's publications about cults
catapulted him to international prominence as an expert on the subject, and justifiably so.

In sum, aside from certain academic areas in which outside work is either unavailable or
unnecessary, students and faculty alike stand everything to gain when faculty enrich their
careers by interspersing field work with academic work.
