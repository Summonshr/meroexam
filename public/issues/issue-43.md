Some educational systems emphasize the development of students' capacity for reasoning
and logical thinking, but students would benefit more from an education that also taught them
to explore their own emotions.

The speaker asserts that educational systems should place less emphasis on reason and
logical thinking and more emphasis on the exploration of emotions. While I concede that in
certain fields students are well served by nurturing their emotions and feelings, in most
academic disciplines it is by cultivating intellect rather than emotions that students master their
discipline and, in turn, gain a capacity to contribute to the well-being of society.

I agree with the speaker insofar as undue emphasis on reason and logical thinking can have
a chilling effect on the arts. After all, artistic ideas and inspiration spring not from logic but from
emotions and feelings such as joy, sadness, hope, and love. And, the true measure of artistic
accomplishment lies not in technical proficiency but rather in a work's impact on the emotions
and spirit. Nevertheless, even in the arts, students must learn theories and techniques, which
they then apply to their craft. And, creative writing requires the cognitive ability to understand
how language is used and how to communicate ideas. Besides, creative ability is itself partly a
function of intellect; that is, creative expression is a marriage of one's cognitive abilities and the
expression of one's feelings and emotions.

Aside from its utility in the arts, however, the exploration of emotions has little place in
educational systems. The physical sciences and mathematics are purely products of reason
and logic. Even in the so-called **soft** sciences, emotion should play no part. Consider, for
example, the study of history, political science, or public policy, each of 'which is largely the
study of how the concepts of fairness, equity, and justice work themselves out. It is tempting to
think that students can best understand and learn to apply these concepts by tapping feelings
such as compassion, empathy, sympathy, and indignation. Yet fairness, equity, and justice
have little to do with feelings, and everything to do with reason. After all, emotions are
subjective things. On the other hand, reason is objective and therefore facilitates
communication, consensus, and peaceful compromise.

Indeed, on a systemic scale undue emphasis on the exploration of our emotions can have
deleterious societal consequences. Emotions invite irrationality in thought and action, the
dangers of which are all too evident in contemporary America. For example, when it comes to
the war on drugs, free speech and religion, abortion issues, and sexual choices, public policy
today seems to simply mirror the voters' fears and prejudices. Yet common sense dictates that
social ills are best solved by identifying cause-and-effect relation-ships---in other words,
through critical thinking. The proliferation of shouting-match talk shows fueled by irrationality
and emotion gone amuck is further evidence that our culture lends too much credence to our
emotions and not enough to our minds. A culture that sanctions irrationality and unfettered
venting of emotion is vulnerable to decline. Indeed, exploiting emotions while suppressing
reason is how demagogues gain and hold power, and how humanity's most horrific atrocities
have come to pass. In contrast, reason and better judgment are effective deterrents to incivility,
despotism, and war.

In sum, emotions can serve as important catalysts for academic accomplishment in the arts.

Otherwise, however, students, and ultimately society, are better off by learning to temper their
emotions while nurturing judgment, tolerance, fairness, and understandlng--all of which are
products of reason and critical thinking.
