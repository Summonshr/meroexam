**While some leaders in government, sports, industry, and other areas attribute their success to
a well-developed sense of competition, a society can better prepare its young people for
leadership by instilling in them a sense of cooperation.**


Which is a better way to prepare young people for leadership: developing in them a spirit of
competitiveness or one of cooperation? The speaker favors the latter approach, even though
some leaders attribute their success to their keenly developed competitive spirit. I tend to
agree with the speaker, for reasons having to do with our increasingly global society, and with
the true keys to effective leadership.

The chief reason why we should stress cooperation in nurturing young people today is that,
as tomorrow's leaders, they will face pressing societal problems that simply cannot be solved
apart from cooperative international efforts. For example, all nations will need to cooperate in
an effort to disarm themselves of weapons of mass destruction; to reduce harmful emissions
which destroy ozone and warm the Earth to dangerous levels; to reduce consumption of the
Earth's finite natural resources; and to cure and prevent diseases before they become global
epidemics. Otherwise, we all risk self-destruction. In short, global peace, economic stability,
and survival of the species provide powerful reasons for developing educational paradigms
that stress cooperation over competition.

A second compelling reason for instilling in young people a sense of cooperation over
competition is that effective leadership depends less on the latter than the former. A leader
should show that he or she values the input of subordinates--for example, by involving them in
decisions about matters in which they have a direct stake. Otherwise, subordinates might grow
to resent their leader, and become unwilling to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the
leader's mission. In extreme cases they might even sabotage that mission, or even take their
useful ideas to competitors. And after all, without other people worth leading a person cannot
be a leader let alone an effective one.

A third reason why instilling a sense of cooperation is to be preferred over instilling a sense
of competition is that the latter serves to narrow a leader's focus on thwarting the efforts of
competitors. With such tunnel vision it is difficult to develop other, more creative means of
attaining organizational objectives. Moreover, such means often involve synergistic solutions
that call for alliances, partnerships, and other cooperative efforts with would-be competitors.

Those who would oppose the speaker might point out that a thriving economy depends on a
freely competitive business environment, which ensures that consumers obtain high-quality
goods and services at low prices. Thus key leadership positions, especially in business,
inherently call for a certain tenacity and competitive spirit. And, a competitive spirit seems
especially critical in today's hyper-competitive technology-driven economy, where any leader
f~iling to keep pace with ever-changing business and technological paradigms soon fails by
the wayside. However, a leader's effectiveness as a competitor is not necessarily inconsistent
with his or her ability to cooperate with subordinates or with competitors, as noted above.

In sum, ifwe were to take the speaker's advice too far we would risk becoming a world
without leaders, who are bred of a competitive spirit. We would also risk the key benefits of a
free-market economy. Nevertheless, on balance I agree that it is more important to instill in
young people a sense of cooperation than one of competition. The speaker's preference
properly reflects the growing role of cooperative alliances and efforts in solving the world's
most pressing problems. After all, in a world in which our very survival as a species depends
on cooperation, the spirit of even healthy competition, no matter how healthy, is of little value to
any of us.
