The chief benefit of the study of history is to break down the illusion that people in one period
of time are significantly different from people who lived at any other time in history.


I concede that basic human nature has not changed over recorded history, and that coming
to appreciate this fact by studying history can be beneficial in how we live as a society.

However, I disagree with the statement in two respects. First, in other ways there are marked
differences between people of different time periods, and learning about those differences can
be just as beneficial. Second, studying history carries other equally important benefits as well.

I agree with the statement insofar as through the earnest study of human history we learn
that basic human nature---our desires and motives, as well as our fears and foibles---has
remained constant over recorded time. And through this realization we can benefit as a society
in dealing more effectively with our enduring social problems. History teaches us, for example,
that it is a mistake to attempt to legislate morality, because humans by nature resist having
their moral choices forced upon them. History also teaches us that our major social ills are
here to stay, because they spring from human nature. For instance, crime and violence have
troubled almost every society; all manner of reform, prevention, and punishment have been
tried with only partial success. Today, the trend appears to be away from reform toward a
**tough-on-crime** approach, to no avail.

However beneficial it might be to appreciate the unchanging nature of humankind, it is
equally beneficial to understand and appreciate significant differences between peoples of
different time periods----in terms of cultural mores, customs, values, and ideals. For example,
the ways in which societies have treated women, ethnic minorities, animals, and the
environment have confin, mlly evolved over the course of human history. Society's attitudes
toward artistic expression, literature, and scientific and intellectual inquiry are also in a
continual state of evolution. And, perhaps the most significant sort of cultural evolution involves
spiritual beliefs, which have always spun themselves out, albeit uneasily, through clashes
between established traditions and more enlightened viewpoints. A heightened awareness of
all these aspects of cultural evolution help us formulate informed, reflective, and enlightened
values and ideals for ourselves; and our society dearly benefits as a result.

Another problem with the statement is that it undervalues other, equally important benefits of
studying history. Learnmgabout the courage and tenacity of history's great explorers, leaders,
and other achievers inspires us to similar accomplishments, or at least to face own fears as we
travel through life. Learning about the mistakes of past societies helps us avoid repeating them.

For instance, the world is slowly coming to learn by studying history that political states whose
authority stems from suppression of individual freedoms invariably fall of their own oppressive
weight. And, learning about one's cultural heritage, or roots, fosters a healthy sense of self and
cultivates an interest in preserving art, literature, and other cultural artifacts--all of which serve
to enrich society.

To sum up, history informs us that basic human nature has not changed, and this history
lesson can help us understand and be more tolerant of one another, as well as develop
compassionate responses to the problems and failings of others. Yet, history has other lessons
to offer us as well. It helps us formulate informed values and ideals for ourselves, inspires us to
great achievements, points out mistakes to avoid, and helps us appreciate our cultural
heritage.
