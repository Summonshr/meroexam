**With the growth of global networks in such areas as economics and communication, there is
no doubt that every aspect of society---including education, politics, the arts, and the
sciences---will benefit greatly from international influences.**

I agree that the globalization of economic and communication networks will heighten
international influences in all four of the areas listed. However, while those influences will no
doubt benefit education and the sciences, the nature of those influences on the arts and on
politics will probably be a mixed one beneficial in some respects yet detrimental in others.

The dearest and most immediate beneficiaries of international influences are students. When
students learn more about other cultures, systems of government, religions, and so forth, they
advance their knowledge and grow in their understanding of humanity--which is, after all, the
final objective of education. Emerging distance-learning technologies, made practicable now
by the Internet, will no doubt carry an especially profound international influence on education.

Distance learning will permit a class of students located all over the world to video-conference
simultaneously with a teacher and with one other, thereby enlivening and enriching
educational experiences.

The sciences dearly benefit from international influences as well. After all, prindples of
physics, chemistry, and mathematics know no political boundaries; thus a useful insight or
discovery can come from a researcher or theorist anywhere in the world. Accordingly, any
technology that enhances global communication can only serve to advance scientific
knowledge. For example, astronomers can now transmit observational data to other scientists
throughout the world the instant they receive that data, so that the entire global community of
astronomers can begin interpreting that data together in a global brain-storming session. The
sciences also benefit from multi-national economic cooperation. Consider, for instance, the
multi-national program to establish a human colony on the Moon. This ambitious project is
possible only because participating nations are pooling their economic resources as well as
scientific talents.

With respect to the arts, however, the speaker's claim is far less convincing. It might seem
that if artists broaden their cultural exposure and real-world experience their art works would
become richer and more diverse. However, the logical consequence of increasing international
influence on the arts is a homogenous global culture in which art becomes increasingly the
same. The end result is not only a chilling effect on artistic creativity, but also a loss of cultural
identity, which seems to be an important sociological and psychological need.

The impact of global networking on political relations might turn out to be a mixed one as
well. Consider, for instance, the current unification of Europe's various monetary systems.

Since Europe's countries are become economically interdependent, it would seem that it
would be in their best interests to cooperate politically with one another. However, discord over
monetary policy might result in member countries withdrawing from the Community, and in a
political schism or other falling out. Consider also the burgeoning global communications
network. On the one hand, it would seem that instant face-to-face communication between
diplomats and world leaders would help avert and quell political and military crises. By the
same token, however, global networking renders any nation's security system more vulnerable.

This point is aptly illustrated by a recent incident involving a high-ranking Pentagon official who
stored top-secret fries on his home computer, which was connected to the Internet without any
firewall precautions. Incidents such as this one might prompt the world's governments to
become more protective of their sovereignty, more insular, and even-paranoid.

In sum, growing international influences that result naturally from global communications
and economic networks can only serve to facilitate education and to advance scientific
knowledge. However, although the same influences no doubt will have an impact on the arts
and on international politics, the speaker's claim that those influences will be beneficial is
dubious, or at least premature, given that global networking is still in its nascent stages.
