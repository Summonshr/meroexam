Progress is best made through discussion among people who have contrasting points of
view.

The speaker contends that progress is best made through discourse among people with
opposing opinions and viewpoints. I strongly agree with this contention. In all realms of human
endeavor, including the behavioral and natural sciences as well as government and law,
debate and disagreement form the foundation for progress.

Regarding the physical sciences, our scientific method is essentially a call for progress
through opposition. Any new theory must withstand rigorous scientific scrutiny. Moreover, the
history of theoretical science is essentially a history of opposing theories. A current example
involves two contrary theories of physics: wave theory and quantum theory. During the last 20
years or so scientists have been struggling to disprove one or the other, or to reconcile them.

By way of this intense debate, theorists have developed a new so-called **string** theory which
indeed reconciles them--at least mathematically. Although **strings** have yet to be confirmed
empirically, string theory might turn out to provide the unifying laws that all matter in the
universe obeys.

The importance of opposing theories is not limited to the purely physical sciences.

Researchers interested in human behavior have for some time been embroiled in the so-called
**nature-nurture** debate, which involves whether behavioral traits are a function of genetic
disposition and brain chemistry (**nature**) or of learning and environment (**nurture**). Not
surprisingly, psychologists and psychiatrists have traditionally adopted sharply opposing
stances in this debate. And it is this very debate that has sparked researchers to discover that
many behavioral traits are largely a function of the unique neurological structure of each
individual's brain, and not a function of nurture. These and further discoveries certainly will
lead to progress in dealing effectively with pressing social issues in the felds of education,
juvenile delinquency, criminal reform, and mental illness. The outcomes of the debate also
carry important implications about culpability and accountability in the eyes of the law. In short,
the nature-nurture debate will continue to serve as a catalyst for progress across the entire
social spectrum.

The value of discourse between people with opposing viewpoints is not limited to the
physical and behavioral sciences. In government and politics, progress in human rights comes
typically through dissension from and challenges to the status quo; in fact, without
disagreement among factions with opposing viewpoints, political oppression and tyranny
would go unchecked. Similarly, in the fields of civil and criminal law, jurists and legislators who
uphold and defend legal precedent must face continual opposition from those who question
the fairness and relevance of current laws. This ongoing debate is critical to the vitality and
relevance of our system of laws.

History informs us of the chilling effect suppression of free discourse and debate can have on
progress. Consider the Soviet Refusenik movement of the 1920s. During this time period the
Soviet government attempted not only to control the direction and the goals of scientific
research but also to distort the outcomes of that research. During the 1920s the Soviet
government quashed certain areas of scientific inquiry, destroyed research facilities and
libraries, and caused the sudden disappearance of scientists who were engaged in research
that the state viewed as a potential threat. Not surprisingly, during this time period no
significant advances in scientific knowledge occurred under the auspices of the Soviet
government.

In sum, the speaker correctly asserts that it is through discourse, disagreement, and debate
between opposing viewpoints that true progress can best be made. Indeed, advances in
science, social welfare, government and law depend on the debate.
