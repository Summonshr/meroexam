**Originality does not mean thinking something that was never thought before; it means putting
old ideas together in new ways.**

Are people who make the greatest contributions to society those who pursue their personal
intellectual interests, as the speaker asserts? Or are they the ones who focus instead on areas
that are most likely to benefit society? I strongly agree with the speaker, for three reasons.

First of all, by human nature we are motivated to pursue activities in which we excel. To
compel people to focus their intellectual interests only on certain areas would be to force many
to waste their true talents. For example, imagine relegating today's preeminent astrophysicist
Stephen Hawking to researching the effectiveness of affirmative-action legislation in reducing
workplace discrimination. Admittedly, this example borders on hyperbole. Yet the aggregate
effect of realistic cases would be to waste the intellectual talents of our world's scholars and
researchers.

Secondly, it is unusual avenues of personal interest that most often lead to the greatest
contributions to society. Intellectual and scientific inquiry that breaks no new ground amount to
wasted time, talent, and other resources. History is laden with quirky claims of scholars and
researchers that turned out stunningly significant--that the sun lies at the center of our universe,
that time and space are relative concepts, that matter consists of discrete particles, that
humans evolved from other life forms, to name a few. One current area of unusual research is
terraforrning---creating biological life and a habitable atmosphere where none existed before.

This unusual research area does not immediately address society's pressing social problems.

Yet in the longer term it might be necessary to colonize other planets in order to ensure the
survival of the human race; and after all, what could be a more significant contribution to
society than preventing its extinction?
Thirdly, to adopt a view that runs contrary to the speaker's position would be to sanction
certain intellectual pursuits while proscribing others which smacks of thought control and
political oppression. It is dangerous to afford ultimate decision-making power about what
intellectual pursuits are worthwhile to a handful of regulators, legislators, or elitists, since they
bring to bear their own quirky notions about what is worthwhile, and since they are notoriously
susceptible to influence-peddling which renders them untrustworthy in any event. Besides,
history informs us well of the danger inherent in setting official research priorities. A telling
modern example involves the Soviet government's attempts during the 1920s to not only
control the direction and the goals of its scientists' research but also to distort the outcome of
that research----ostensibly for the greatest good of the greatest number of people. During the
1920s the Soviet government quashed certain areas of scientific inquiry, destroyed entire
research facilities and libraries, and caused the sudden disappearance of many scientists who
were viewed as threats to the state's authority. Not surprisingly, during this time period no
significant scientific advances occurred under the auspices of the Soviet government.

Those who would oppose the speaker's assertion might argue that intellectual inquiry in
certain areas, particularly the arts and humanities, amounts to little more than a personal quest
for happiness or pleasure, and therefore is of little benefit to anyone but the inquirer. This
specious argument overlooks the palpable benefits of cultivating the arts. It also ignores the
fact that earnest study in the humanities affords us wisdom to know what is best for society,
and helps us understand and approach societal problems more critically, creatively, and
effectively. Thus, despite the lack of a tangible nexus between certain areas of intellectual
inquiry and societal benefit, the nexus is there nonetheless.

In sum, I agree that society is best served when people are allowed unfettered freedom of
intellectual inquiry and research, and use that freedom to pursue their own personal interests.

Engaging one's individual talents in one's particular area of fascination is most likely to yield
advances, discoveries, and a heightened aesthetic appreciation that serve to make the world a
better and more interesting place in which to live.
