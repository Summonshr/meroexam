People who pursue their own intellectual interests for purely personal reasons are more likely
to benefit the rest of the world than are people who try to act for the public good.

I strongly agree with the speaker's threshold claim that international relations can never be
completely harmonious. To assert otherwise would be Pollyannaish and would fly in the face of
human history--which is largely a story of power struggles, war, and general discord between
nations and cultures. However, the speaker's rationale, although appealing and not without
merit, is inadequate to explain why total accord among all nations is impossible.

Supporting the speaker's claim is the fact that each culture has its own distinct ethos--
consisting of its core values, principles, and spirit which defines and distinguishes the culture.

And I agree that the failure of one culture to understand the unique ethos of another is what
often lies at the root of discord between nations and cultures. An apt current-day illustration of
this point involves a certain American Indian tribe in Washington State, and its traditional
custom of whale hunting. Environmentalists denounce the practice as unnecessary
endangerment of a species. However, underlying this custom is a centuries-old spiritual belief
that ceremonial whale-hunting is sacrificial ritual honoring Nature, and an even more
fundamental Native American ethos, characterized by a far greater respect for animals and for
Nature than the ethos of white Americans.

The sort of unfair judgment exemplified by certain white Americans' denunciation of Native
American customs and practices is what sociologists term **ethnocentricity**-- reference to
one's own cultural ethos as a standard for judging the values and actions of other people.

History informs us all too well that ethnocentricity leads inexorably to disharmony. Virtually all
wars are rooted in religious ethnocentricity. Political ethnocentricity results in
imperialism--assimilation of any and all peoples with complete disregard or respect for ethos.

Understandable resistance to British imperialism during the 19th Century resulted in the
oppression and demise of many indigenous peoples of Africa and Indonesia. And
ethnocentricity on a societal level can lead to mass persecution, as demonstrated by the
legions of citizens and soldiers brainwashed by the Nazis into believing that the Jewish race
posed some sort of threat to German society and to the Arian race.

Thus the speaker's contention that harmonious international relations are impossible
because of conflicting cultural values finds ample support from history. Yet, as compelling as
this argument might be, it nevertheless suffers from two notable deficiencies. First, in spite of
their differences the world's mainstream cultures all share certain fundamental
tenets--particularly about the dignity of human life and that they all agree upon these tenets,
at least tacitly. And people should judge other cultures against such universal standards.

Otherwise, the end result is that we find ourselves acquiescing in or even sanctioning war and
other such atrocities. Since all cultures share a universal ethos the speaker's rationale seems
inadequate. Discord occurs not only as a result of an ethos clash but also upon violation of the
universal ethos.

A second problem with the speaker's rationale is that it overlooks the fact that we can find
considerable discord within almost every culture. On a microcosmic scale we all observe
so-caUed infighting among members of the same church congregations, political factions, and
so forth. On a larger scale infighting is all too evident--from overt gang warfare and civil war to
covert corporate espionage and political back-stabbing. Thus even if all cultures were to share
the same ethos the promise of complete harmony would still be an illusory one. In short,
contentiousness seems to be part of human nature.

To sum up, I agree with the speaker that complete harmony among nations is unrealistic, but
not just because of conflicting cultural values; it runs contrary to human nature. Yet, the outlook
for international relations is not necessarily so grim. An enlightened understanding of the ethos
of other cultures, and of our own cultural bias, can foster a universal ethos of respect for
human dignity and life. The end result would be to stem, or at least minimize, discord among
nations and cultures.
