Technology creates more problems than it solves, and may threaten or damage the quality of
life.

Whether technology enhances or diminishes our overall quality of life depends largely on the
type of technology one is considering. While mechanical automation may have diminished our
quality of life on balance, digital automation is doing more to improve life than to undermine its
quality.

First consider mechanical automation, particularly assembly-line manufacturing. With
automation came a loss of pride in and alienation from one's work. In this sense, automation
both diminished our quality of life and rendered us slaves to machines in our inability to
reverse **progress**. Admittedly, mechanical automation spawned entire industries, creating
jobs, stimulating economic growth, and supplying a plethora of innovative conveniences.

Nevertheless, the sociological and environmental price of progress may have outweighed its
benefits.

Next consider digital technology. Admittedly, this newer form of technology has brought its
own brand of alienation, and has adversely affected our quality of life in other ways as well. For
example, computer automation, and especially the Internet, breeds information overload and
steals our time and attention away from family, community, and coworkers. In these respects,
digital technology tends to diminish our quality of life and create its own legion of human
slaves.

On the other hand, by relegating repetitive tasks to computers, digital technology has
spawned great advances in medicine and physics, helping us to better understand the world,
to enhance our health, and to prolong our lives. Digital automation has also emancipated
architects, artists, designers, and musicians, by expanding creative possibilities and by saving
time. Perhaps most important, however, information technology makes possible universal
access to information, thereby providing a democratizing influence on our cultul:e.

In sum, while mechanical automation may have created a society of slaves to modern
conveniences and unfulfRling work, digital automation holds more promise for improving our
lives without enslaving us to the technology.
