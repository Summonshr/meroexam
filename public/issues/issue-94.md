Practicality is now our great idol, which all powers and talents must serve. Anything that is not
obviously practical has little value in today's world.

In today's world is practicality our idol---one which all powers and talents must serve. While
this claim has considerable merit with respect to most areas of human endeavor--including
education, art, and politics--I take exception with the claim when it comes to the direction of
scientific research today.

Practicality seems clearly to be the litmus test for education today. Grade-schoolers are
learning computer skills right along with reading and writing. Our middle and high schools are
increasingly cutting arts education, which ostensibly has less practical value than other course
work. And, more and more college students are majoring in technical fields for the purpose of
securing lucrative jobs immediately upon graduation. Admittedly, many college students still
advance to graduate-level study; yet the most popular such degree today is the MBA; after all,
business administration is fundamentally about practicality and pragmatism that is, **getting
the job done** and paying attention to the **bottom line**.

Practicality also dictates what sort of art is produced today. Most new architecture today is
driven by functionality, safety, and cost; very few architectural masterpieces find their way past
the blueprint stage anymore. The content of today's feature films and music is driven entirely
by demographic considerations--that is, by pandering to the interests of 18-35 year olds, who
account for most ticket and CD sales. And, the publishing industry today is driven by
immediate concern to deliver viable products to the marketplace. The glut of how-to books in
our bookstores today is evidence that publishers are pandering to our practicality as well. It
isn't that artists no longer create works of high artistic value and integrity. Independent record
labels, filmmakers, and publishing houses abound today. It's just that the independents do not
thrive, and they constitute a minuscule segment of the market. In the main, today's real-estate
developers, entertainment moguls, and publishing executives are concerned with practicality
and profit, and not with artistic value and integrity.

Practicality is also the overriding concern in contemporary politics. Most politicians seem
driven today by their interest in being elected and reelected that is, in short-term survival
rather than by any sense of mission, or even obligation to their constituency or country.

Diplomatic and legal maneuverings and negotiations often appear intended to meet the
practical needs of the parties involved minimizing costs, preserving options, and so forth.

Those who would defend the speaker might claim that it is idealists--not pragmatists who
sway the masses, incite revolutions, and make political ideology reality. Consider idealists
such as the America's founders, or Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King. Had these
idealists concerned themselves with short-term survival and immediate needs rather than with
their notions of an ideal society, the United States and India might still be British colonies, and
African-Americans might still be relegated to the backs of buses. Although I concede this point,
the plain fact is that such idealists are far fewer in number today.

On the other hand, the claim amounts to an overstatement when it comes to today's
scientific endeavors. In medicine the most common procedures today are cosmetic; these
procedures strike me as highly impractical, given the health risks and expense involved.

Admittedly, today's digital revolution serves a host of practical concerns, such as
communicating and accessing information more quickly and efficiently. Much of chemical
research is also aimed at practicality--at providing convenience and enhancing our immediate
comfort. Yet, in many other respects scientific research is not driven toward immediate
practicality but rather toward broad, long-term objectives: public health, quality of life, and
environmental protection.

In sum, practicality may be our idol today when it comes to education, the arts, and politics;
but with respect to science I find the claim to be an unfair generalization. Finally, query whether
the claim begs the question. After all, practicality amounts to far more than meeting immediate
needs; it also embraces long-term planning and prevention aimed at ensuring our future
quality of life, and our very survival as a species.
