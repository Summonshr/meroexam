Most people choose a career on the basis of such pragmatic considerations as the needs of
the economy, the relative ease of finding a job, and the salary they can expect to make. Hardly
anyone is free to choose a career based on his or her natural talents or interest in a particular
kind of work.

The speaker believes that economic and other pragmatic concerns are what drive people's
career decisions, and that very few people are free to choose their careers based on their
talents and interests. I tend to disagree; although practical considerations often play a
significant role in occupational trends, ultimately the driving forces behind people's career
decisions are individual interest and ability.

At first glance the balance of empirical evidence would seem to lend considerable credence
to the speaker's claim. The most popular fields of study for students today are the computer
sciences--fields characterized by a relative glut of job opportunities. Graduates with degrees in
liberal arts often abandon their chosen fields because they cannot find employment, and
reenter school in search of more **practical** careers. Even people who have already achieved
success in their chosen field are often forced to abandon them due to pragmatic concerns. For
example, many talented and creative people from the entertainment industry find themselves
looking for other, less satisfying, kinds of work when they turn 40 years of age because
industry executives prefer younger artists who are **tuned in** to the younger demographic
group that purchases entertainment products.

However, upon further reflection it becomes clear that the relationship between
career-seekers and the supply of careers is an interdependent one, and therefore it is unfair to
generalize about which one drives the other. Consider, for example, the two mainstream fields
of computer science and law. In the computer industry it might appear that supply dearly drives
job interest--and understandably so, given the highly lucrative financial rewards. But, would
our legions of talented programmers, engineers, scientists, and technicians really pursue their
careers without a genuine fascination, a passion, or at least an interest in those areas? I think
not.

Conversely, consider the field of law, in which it would appear that demand drives the job
market, rather than vice versa. The number of applications to law schools soared during the
civil rights movement of the 1960s, and again in the 1980s during the run of the popular
television series LA. Lmv. More recently, the number of students pursuing paralegal and
criminal-justice careers spiked during and immediately after the O.J. Simpson trial. Query,
though, whether these aspiring lawyers and paralegals wood have been sufficiently motivated
had the supply of jobs and the financial rewards not already been waiting for them upon
graduation.

Another compelling argument against the speaker's claim has to do with the myriad of ways
in which people earn their living. Admittedly, the job market is largely clustered around certain
mainstream industries and types of work. Nevertheless, if one peers beyond these mainstream
occupational areas it becomes evident that many, many people do honor their true interests
and talents--in spite of where most job openings lie and regardless of their financial rewards.

Creative people seem to have a knack for creating their own unique vocational niche
whether it be in the visual or the performing arts; many animal lovers create work which allows
them to express that love. Caregivers and nurturers manage to find work teaching, socializing,
counseling, and healing others. And people bitten by the travel bug generally have little trouble
finding satisfying careers in the travel industry.

In sum, the speaker's threshold claim that it is strictly the pragmatic concerns of job
availability and financial compensation that drive people's career decisions oversimplifies both
why and how people make career choices. Besides, the speaker's final claim that people are
not free to choose their work violates my intuition. In the final analysis, people are ultimately
free to choose their work; it's just that they often choose to betray their true talents and
interests for the sake of practical, economic considerations.
