The material progress and well-being of one country are necessarily connected to the
material progress and well-being of all other countries.

I strongly agree that each nation's progress and well-being are now tied to the progress and
well-being of other nations. In the pursuit of its citizens' economic and social welfare, as well
as their safety, security, and health, each nation today creates a ripple effect-- sometimes
beneficial and sometimes detrimentS---felt around the globe. And, although I disagree that our
global interconnectedness is necessary, in all likelihood it is with us to stay.

Turning first to economic progress and well-being, the economic pursuits of any nation today
are not merely connected to but actually interwoven with those of other nations. In some cases
one nation's progress is another's problem. For instance, strong economic growth in the U.S.

attracts investment in U.S. equities from foreign investors, to the detriment of foreign business
investments, which become less attractive by comparison. Or consider the global
repercussions of developed nations' over-consumption of natural resources mined from
emerging nations. Having been exploited once for the sake of fueling the high standard of
living in the developed world, emerging nations are now being pressured to comply with the
same energy conservation policies as their exploiters--even though they did not contribute to
the problems giving rise to these policies, and cannot afford to make the sacrifices involved.

Finally, although international drug trafficking provides an economic boon for the rogue nations
supplying the drugs, it carries deleterious economic, social, and public-health consequences
for user nations.

In other cases the economic connection between nations is synergistic--either mutually
beneficial or detrimental. A financial crisis--or a political crisis or natural disaster in one country
can spell trouble for foreign companies, many of which are now multinational in that they rely
on the labor forces, equipment, and raw materials of other nations. And, as trade barriers and
the virtual distance between nations collapse, the result is economic synergies among all
trading nations. For instance, the economic well-being of Middle East nations relies almost
entirely on demand from oil-consuming nations such as the U.S., which depend on a steady
supply from the Middle East.

Nations have also become interconnected in the pursuit of scientific and technological
progress. And while it might be tempting to hasten that the ripples generally benefit other
nations, often one nation's pursuit of progress spells trouble for other nations. For example,
the development of nudear weapons and biological and chemical agents affords the nation
possessing them political and military leverage over other nations. And, global computer
connectivity has served to heighten national-security concerns of all connected nations who
can easily fall prey to Internet espionage.

Finally, the world's nations have become especially interconnected in terms of their public
health. Prior to the modern industrial age, no nation had the capacity to inflict lasting
environmental damage on other nations. But, as that age draws to a close it is evident that
so-called industrial **progress** has carried deleterious environmental consequences worldwide.

Consider, for instance, the depletion of atmospheric ozone, which has warmed the Earth to the
point that it threatens the very survival of the human species. And, we are now learning that
dear-cutting the world's rainforests can set into motion a chain of animal extinction that
threatens the delicate balance upon which all animals--including humans--depend.

In closing, I take exception to the statement only insofar as a nation can still pursue progress
and the well-being of its own citizens in relative isolation from other nations. And I concede that
in the future the world's nations might respond to the health and security risks of the ripple
effect that I've described by adopting isolationist trade, communications, and military policies.

Yet, having benefited from the economic synergies which free trade and global financial
markets afford, and having seen the potential for progress technological revolution has
brought about, I think that the world's nations will be willing to assume those risks.
