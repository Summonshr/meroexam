The absence of choice is a circumstance that is very, very rare.

I strongly agree with the contention that absence of choice is a rare circumstance, primarily
because this contention accords with common sense and our everyday experience as human
beings. Besides, the reverse claim that we do not have free choice--serves to undermine the
notions of moral accountability and human equality, which are critical to the survival of any
democratic society.

Our collective life experience is that we make choices and decisions every day----on a
continual basis. Common sense dictates that humans have free will, and therefore the true
absence of choice is very rare. The only possible exceptions would involve extreme and rare
circumstances such as solitary imprisonment or a severe mental or physical deftciency--any of
which might potentially strip a person of his or her ability to make conscious choices. Yet even
under these circumstances, a person still retains choices about voluntary bodily functions and
movement. Thus the complete absence of choice would seem to be possible only in a
comatose state or in death.

People often claim that life's circumstances leave them with **no choice.** One might feel
trapped in a job or a marriage. Under financial duress a person might claim that he or she has
**no choice** but to declare bankruptcy, take a demeaning job, or even lie or steal to obtain
money. The fundamental problem with these sorts of claims is that the claimants are only
considering those choices that are not viable or attractive. That is, people in situations such as
these have an infinite number of choices; it's just that many of the choices are unappealing,
even self-defeating. For example, almost every person who claims to be trapped in a job is
simply choosing to retain a certain measure of financial security. The choice to forego this
security is always available, although it might carry unpleasant consequences.

Besides, the contention that we are almost invariably free to choose is far more appealing
from a socio-political standpoint than the opposite claim. A complete lack of choice implies that
every person's fate is determined, and that we all lack free will. According to the philosophical
school of **strict determinism,** every event, induding human actions and choices, that occurs is
physically necessary given the laws of nature and events that preceded that event or choice.

In other words, the **choices** that seem part of the essence of our being are actually beyond
our control. Recent advances in molecular biology and genetics lend some credence to the
determinists' position that as physical beings our actions are determined by physical forces
beyond our control. New research suggests that these physical forces include our own
individual genetic makeup.

However, the logical result of strict determinism and of the new **scientific determinism** is
that we are not morally accountable for our actions and choices, even those that harm other
individuals or society. Moreover, throughout history monarchs and dictators have embraced
determinism, at least ostensibly, to bolster their claim that certain individuals are preordained
to assume positions of authority or to rise to the top levels of the socioeconomic infrastructure.

Finally, the notion of scientific determinism opens the door for genetic engineering, which
poses a potential threat to equality in socioeconomic opportunity, and could lead to the
development of a so-caUed **master race.** Admittedly, these disturbing implications neither
prove nor disprove the determinists' claims. Nevertheless, assuming that neither free will nor
determinism has been proven to be the correct position, the former is to be preferred by any
humanist and in any democratic society.

In sum, despite the fact that we all experience occasional feelings of being trapped and
having no choice, the statement is fundamentally correct. I would concede that science might
eventually disprove the very notion of free will. However, until that time I'll trust my strong
intuition that free will is an essential part of our being as humans and, accordingly, that humans
are responsible for their own choices and actions.
