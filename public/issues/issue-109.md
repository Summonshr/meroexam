**Society should identify those children who have special talents and abilities and begin training
them at an early age so that they can eventually excel in their areas of ability. Otherwise, these
talents are likely to remain undeveloped.**

I agree that we should attempt to identify and cultivate our children's talents. However, in my
view the statement goes too far, by suggesting that selected children receive special attention.

If followed to the letter, this suggestion carries certain social, psychological, and human-rights
implications that might turn out to be more harmful than beneficial not just to children but to the
entire society.

At frrst blush the statement appears compelling. Although I am not a student of
developmental psychology, my understanding is that unless certain innate talents are nurtured
and cultivated during early childhood those talents can remain forever dormant; and both the
child and the society stand to lose as a result. After all, how can a child who is musically gifted
ever see those gifts come to fruition without access to a musical instrument? Or, how can a
child who has a gift for linguistics ever learn a foreign language without at least some exposure
to it? Thus I agree with the statement insofar as any society that values its own future
well-being must be attentive to its children's talents.

Beyond this concession, however, I disagree with the statement because it seems to
recommend that certain children receive special attention at the expense of other children--a
recommendation that I find troubling in three respects. First, this policy would require that a
society of parents make choices that they surely will never agree upon to begin with---for
example, how and on what basis each child's talents should be deter mined, and what sorts of
talents are most worth society's time, attention, and resources. While society's parents would
never reach a reasonable consensus on these issues, it would be irresponsible to leave these
choices to a handful of legislators and bureaucrats.

After all, they are unlikely to have the best interests of our children in mind, and their choices
would be tainted by their own quirky, biased, and otherwise wrongheaded notions of what
constitutes worthwhile talent. Thus the unanswerable question becomes: Who is to make
these choices to begin with?
Secondly, a public policy whereby some children receive preferential treatment carries
dangerous sociological implications. The sort of selectivity that the statement recommends
might tend to split society into two factions: talented elitists and all others. In my view any
democratic society should abhor a policy that breeds or exacerbates socioeco nomic
disparities.

Thirdly, in suggesting that it is in society's best interest to identify especially talented children,
the statement assumes that talented children are the ones who are most likely to contribute
greatly to the society as adults. I find this assumption somewhat dubious, for I see no reason
why a talented child, having received the benefit of special attention, might nevertheless be
unmotivated to ply those talents in useful ways as an adult. In fact, in my observation many
talented people who misuse their talents--in ways that harm the very society that helped
nurture those talents.

Finally, the statement ignores the psychological damage that a preferential policy might
inflict on all children. While children selected for special treatment grow to deem themselves
superior, those left out feel that they a worth less as a result. I think any astute child
psychologist would warn that both types of cases portend psychological trouble later in life. In
my view we should favor policies that affirm the self-worth of every child, regardless of his or
her talents---or lack thereof. Otherwise, we will quickly devolve into a society of people who
cheapen their own humanity.

In the final analysis, when we help our children identify and develop their talents we are all
better off. But ifwe help only some children to develop only some talents, I fear that on balance
we will all be worse off.
