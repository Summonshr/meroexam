Humanity has made little real progress over the past century or so. Technological innovations
have taken place, but the overall condition of humanity is no better. War, violence, and poverty
are still with us. Technology cannot change the condition of humanity.

Have technological innovations of the last century failed to bring about true progress for
humanity, as the statement contends? Although I agree that technology cannot ultimately
prevent us from harming one another, the statement fails to account for the significant positive
impact that the modem-industrial and computer revolutions have had on the quality of life at
least in the developed world.

I agree with the statement insofar as there is no technological solution to the enduring
problems of war, poverty, and violence, for the reason that they stem from certain aspects of
human nature--such as aggression and greed. Although future advances in biochemistry might
enable us to **engineer away** those undesirable aspects, in the meantime it is up to our
economists, diplomats, social reformers, and jurists--not our scientists and engineers--to
mitigate these problems.

Admittedly, many technological developments during the last century have helped reduce
human suffering. Consider, for instance, technology that enables computers to map Earth's
geographical features from outer space. This technology allows us to locate lands that can be
cultivated for feeding malnourished people in third-world countries. And, few would disagree
that humanity is the beneficiary of the myriad of 20th-Century innovations in medicine and
medical technology--from prostheses and organ transplants to vaccines and lasers.

Yet, for every technological innovation helping to reduce human suffering is another that has
served primarily to add to it. For example, while some might argue that nuclear weapons serve
as invaluable **peace-keepers,** this argument flies in the face of the hundreds of thousands of
innocent people murdered and maimed by atomic blasts. More recently, the increasing use of
chemical weapons for human slaughter points out that socalled **advances** in biochemistry
can amount to net losses for humanity.

Notwithstanding technology's limitations in preventing war, poverty, and violence,
20th-Century technological innovation has enhanced the overall standard of living and comfort
level of developed nations. The advent of steel production and assembly-line manufacturing
created countless jobs, stimulated economic growth, and supplied a plethora of innovative
conveniences. More recently, computers have helped free up our time by performing repetitive
tasks; have aided in the design of safer and more attractive bridges, buildings, and vehicles;
and have made possible universal access to information.

Of course, such progress has not come without costs. One harmful byproduct of industrial
progress is environmental pollution, and its threat to public health. Another is the alienation of
assembly-line workers from their work. And, the Internet breeds information overload and
steals our time and attention away from family, community, and coworkers. Nevertheless, on
balance both the modern-industrial and computer revolutions have improved our standard of
living and comfort level; and both constitute progress by any measure.

In sum, enduring problems such as war, poverty, and violence ultimately spring from human
nature, which no technological innovation short of genetic engineering can alter. Thus the
statement is correct in this respect. However, ifwe define **progress** more narrowly--in terms of
economic standard of living and comfort level--recent technological innovations have indeed
brought about clear progress for humanity.
