**Most people would agree that buildings represent a valuable record of any society's past, but
controversy arises when old buildings stand on ground that modern planners feel could be
better used for modern purposes. In such situations, modern development should be given
precedence over the preservation of historic buildings so that contemporary needs can be
served.**

The speaker asserts that wherever a practical, utilitarian need for new buildings arises this
need should take precedence over our conflicting interest in preserving historic buildings as a
record of our past. In my view, however, which interest should take precedence should be
determined on a case-by-case basis--and should account not only for practical and historic
considerations but also aesthetic ones.

In determining whether to raze an older building, planners should of course consider the
community's current and anticipated utilitarian needs. For example, if an additional hospital is
needed to adequately serve the health-care needs of a fast-growing community, this
compelling interest might very well outweigh any interest in preserving a historic building that
sits on the proposed site. Or if additional parking is needed to ensure the economic survival of
a city's downtown district, this interest might take precedence over the historic value of an old
structure that stands in the way of a parking structure. On the other hand, if the need is mainly
for more office space, in some cases an architecturally appropriate add-on or annex to an
older building might serve just as well as razing the old building to make way for a new one. Of
course, an expensive retrofit might not be worthwhile if no amount of retrofitting would meet
the need.

Competing with a community's utilitarian needs is an interest preserving the historical record.

Again, the weight of this interest should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Perhaps an
older building uniquely represents a bygone era, or once played a central role in the city's
history as a municipal structure. Or perhaps the building once served as the home of a
founding family or other significant historical figure, or as the location of an important historical
event. Any of these scenarios might justify saving the building at the expense of the practical
needs of the community. On the other hand, if several older buildings represent the same
historical era just as effectively, or if the building's history is an unremarkable one, then the
historic value of the building might pale in comparison to the value of a new structure that
meets a compelling practical need.

Also competing with a community's utilitarian needs is the aesthetic and architectural value
of the building itself--apart from historical events with which it might be associated. A building
might be one of only a few that represents a certain architectural style. Or it might be especially
beautiful, perhaps as a result of the craftsmanship and materials employed in its
construction--which might be cost-prohibitive to replicate today. Even retrofitting the building to
accommodate current needs might undermine its aesthetic as well as historic value, by
altering its appearance and architectural integrity. Of course it is difficult to quantify aesthetic
value and weigh it against utilitarian considerations. Yet planners should strive to account for
aesthetic value nonetheless.

In sum, whether to raze an older building in order to construct a new one should never be
determined indiscriminately. Instead, planners should make such decisions on a case-by-case
basis, weighing the community's practical needs against the building's historic and aesthetic
value.
