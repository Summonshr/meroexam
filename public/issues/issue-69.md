There is no such thing as purely objective observation. All observation is subjective; it is
always guided by the observer's expectations or desires.

The speaker claims that all observation is subjective--colored by desire and expectation.

While it would be tempting to concede that we all see things differently, careful scrutiny of the
speaker's claim reveals that it confuses observation with interpretation. In fact, in the end the
speaker's claim relies entirely on the further claim that there is no such thing as truth and that
we cannot truly know anything. While this notion might appeal to certain existentialists and
epistemologists, it runs against the grain of all scientific discovery and knowledge gained over
the last 500 years.

It would be tempting to afford the speaker's daim greater merit than it deserves. After all, our
everyday experience as humans informs us that we often disagree about what we observe
around us. We've all uttered and heard uttered many times the phase **That's not the way I see
it!** Indeed, everyday observations--for example, about whether a football player was out of
bounds, or about which car involved in an accident ran the red light--vary depending not only
on one's spatial perspective but also on one's expectations or desires. If I'm rooting for one
football team, or if the player is well-known for his ability to make great plays while barely
staying in bounds, my desires or expectations might influence what I think I observe. Or if I am
driving one of the cars in the accident, or if one car is a souped-up sports car, then my desires
or expectations will in all likelihood color my perception of the accident's events.

However, these sorts of subjective **observations** are actually subjective **interpretations** of
what we observe. Visitors to an art museum might disagree about the beauty of a particular
work, or even about which color predominates in that work. In a court trial several jurors might
view the same videotape evidence many times, yet some jurors might **observe** an incident of
police brutality, will others **observe** the appropriate use of force to restrain a dangerous
individual. Thus when it comes to making judgments about what we observe and about
remembering what we observe, each person's individual perspective, values, and even
emotions help form these judgments and recollections. It is crucial to distinguish between
interpretations such as these and observation, which is nothing more than a sensory
experience. Given the same spatial perspective and sensory acuity and awareness, it seems
to me that our observations would all be essentially in accord--that is, observation can be
objective.

Lending credence to my position is Francis Bacon's scientific method, according to which we
can know only that which we observe, and thus all truth must be based on empirical
observation. This profoundly important principle serves to expose and strip away all subjective
interpretation of observation, thereby revealing objective scientific truths. For example, up until
Bacon's time the Earth was **observed** to lie at the center of the Universe, in accordance with
the prevailing religious notion that man (humankind) was the center of God's creation.

Applying Bacon's scientific method Galileo exposed the biased nature of this claim. Similarly,
before Einstein time and space were assumed to be linear, in accordance with our
**observation.** Einstein's mathematical formulas suggested otherwise, and his theories have
been proven empirically to be true. Thus it was our subjective interpretation of time and space
that led to our misguided notions about them. Einstein, like history's other most influential
scientists, simply refused to accept conventional interpretations of what we all observe.

In sum, the speaker confuses observation with interpretation and recollection. It is how we
make sense of what we observe, not observation itself, that is colored by our perspective,
expectations, and desires. The gifted individuals who can set aside their subjectivity and delve
deeper into empirical evidence, employing Bacon's scientific method, are the ones who reveal
that observation not only can be objective but must be objective if we are to embrace the more
fundamental notion that knowledge and truth exist.
