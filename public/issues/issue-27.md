Society does not place enough emphasis on the intellect---that is, on reasoning and other
cognitive skills.

The speaker asserts that society should place more emphasis on intellect and cognition.

While the speaker might overlook the benefits of nurturing certain emotions and feelings, on
balance I agree that it is by way of our heads rather than our hearts that we can best ensure
the well-being of our society.

I concede that undue emphasis on cultivating the intellect at the expense of healthy
emotions can harm an individual psychologically. Undue suppression of legitimate and healthy
desires and emotions can result in depression, dysfunction, and even physical illness. In fact,
the intellect can mask such problems, thereby exacerbating them. To the extent they occur on
a mass scale these problems become societal ones--lowering our economic productivity,
burdening our health-care and social-welfare systems, and so forth. I also concede that by
encouraging and cultivating certain positive emotions and feelings--such as compassion and
empathy--society dearly stands to benefit.

In many other respects, however, emphasizing emotions and de-emphasizing intellect can
carry negative, even dangerous, consequences for any society. Our collective sense of
fairness, equity, and justice can easily give way to base instincts like hate, greed, and lust for
power and domination. Thus, on balance any society is better off quelling or at least tempering
these sorts of instincts, by nurturing reason, judgment, tolerance, fairness, and
understanding--all of which are products of the intellect.

The empirical evidence supporting this position is overwhelming; yet one need look no
further than a television set. Most of us have been witness to the current trend in trashy talk
shows, which eschew anything approaching intellectual discourse in favor of pan &ring to our
baser urges and instincts like jealousy, lust and hate. Episodes often devolve into anti-social,
sometimes violent, behavior on the part of participants and observers alike. And any ostensible
**lessons learned** from such shows hardly justify the antisocial outbursts that the producers
and audiences of these shows hope for.

The dangers of a de-emphasis on intellect are all too evident in contemporary America.The
incidence of hate crimes is increasing at a startUng rate; gang warfare is at an all-time high;
the level of distrust between African Americans and white America seems to be growing.

Moreover, taken to an extreme and on a mass scale, appeal to the emotions rather than the
intellect has resulted in humanity's most horrific atrocities, like the Jewish holocaust, as well as
in nearly every holy war ever waged throughout history. Indeed, suppressing reason is how
demagogues and despots gain and hold their power over their citizen-victims. In contrast,
reason and better judgment are effective deterrents to despotism, demagoguery, and
especially to war.

Those opposed to the speaker's position might argue that stressing cognition and intellect at
the expense of emotion and feeling would have a chilling effect on artistic creativity, which
would work a harm to the society. However, even in the arts students must learn theories and
techniques, which they then apply to their craft whether it be music performance, dance, or
acting. And creative writing requires the cognitive ability to understand how language is used
and how to best communicate ideas. Besides, creative ability is itsdf partly a function of
intellect; that is, creative expression is a marriage between cognitive ability and the expression
of feelings and emotions.

In sum, emotions and feelings can serve as important catalysts for compassion and for
creativity. Yet behaviors that are most harmful to any society are also born of emotions and
instincts, which the intellect can serve to override. The inescapable conclusion, then, is that
the speaker is fundamentally correct.
