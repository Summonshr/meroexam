**Colleges and universities should offer more courses on popular music, film, advertising, and
television because contemporary culture has much greater relevance for students than do arts
and literature of the past.**

The speaker asserts that the curriculum of colleges and universities should emphasize popular
culture--music, media, literature, and so forth rather than literature and art of the past, for the
reason that the former is more relevant to students. I strongly disagree. Although courses in
popular culture do play a legitimate role in higher education, formal study of the present culture
at the expense of studying past cultures can undermine the function of higher education, and
ultimately provide a disservice to students and to society.

Admittedly, course work in popular culture is legitimate and valuable for three reasons. First,
popular culture is a mirror of society's impulses and values. Thus, any serious student of the
social sciences, as well as students of media and communications, should take seriously the
literature and art of the present. Secondly, in every age and culture some worthwhile art and
literature emerges from the mediocrity. Few would disagree, for example, that the great
modem-jazz pioneers such as Charlie Parker and Thelonius Monk, and more recently Lennon
and McCarmey, and Stevie Wonder, have made just as lasting a contribution to music as some
of the great classical musicians of previous centuries. Thirdly, knowledge of popular films,
music, and art enables a person to find common ground to relate to other people. This leads to
better communication between different subcultures.

Nevertheless, emphasizing the study of popular culture at the expense of studying classical
art and literature can carry harmful consequences for students, as well as for society. Without
the benefit of historical perspective gamed through the earnest study of the art and literature of
the past, it is impossible to fully understand, appreciate, and critique literature and art of the
present. Moreover, by approaching popular culture without any yardstick for quality it is
impossible to distinguish mediocre art from worthwhile art. Only by studying the classics can
an individual develop fair standards for judging popular works. Besides, emphasis on the
formal study of popular culture is unnecessary. Education in popular culture is readily available
outside the classroom---on the Internet, through educational television programming, and
through the sorts of everyday conversations and cross-talk that occur at water coolers and in
the coffee houses of any college campus.

In sum, while the study of popular literature and art can be worthwhile, it has to be
undertaken in conjunction with an even greater effort to learn about the literature and art of the
past. In the absence of the latter, our universities will produce a society of people with no
cultural perspective, and without any standards for determining what merits our attention and
nurtures society.
