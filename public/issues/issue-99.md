**The goal of politics should not be the pursuit of an ideal, but rather the search for common
ground and reasonable consensus.**


Should educators focus equally on enriching students' personal lives and on job preparation,
as the speaker contends? In my view, preparing students for the mundane aspects of work
should be secondary to providing a broader education that equips students with historical and
cultural perspective, as well as thoughtful and principled personal value systems and priorities.

Paradoxically, it is through the liberal studies, which provide these forms of personal
enrichment, that students can also best prepare for the world of work.

One reason why educators should emphasize personal enrichment over job preparation is
that rote technical knowledge and skill do not help a student determine which goals in life are
worthwhile and whether the means of attaining those goals are ethically or morally acceptable.

Liberal studies such as philosophy, history, and comparative sociology enable students to
develop thoughtful and consistent value systems and ethical standards, by which students can
determine how they can best put their technical knowledge and skills to use in the working
world. Thus, by nurturing the development of thoughtful personal value systems, educators
actually help prepare students for their jobs and careers.

Another reason why educators should emphasize personal enrichment over job preparation
is that specific knowledge and skills needed for jobs are changing more and more quickly.

Thus it would be a waste of our education system to focus on specific knowledge and skills
that will soon become obsolete--at the expense of providing a lasting and personally satisfying
educational experience. It seems more appropriate today for employers to provide the training
our work force needs to perform their jobs, freeing up our educators to help enrich students'
lives in ways that will serve them in any walk of life.

A third reason why educators should emphasize personally enriching course
work--particularly anthropology, sociology, history, and political philosophy--is that these
courses help students understand, appreciate, and respect other people and their viewpoints.

As these students grow into working adults they will be better able to cooperate, compromise,
understand various viewpoints, and appreciate the rights and duties of coworkers, supervisors,
and subordinates. Rote technical knowledge and skill do little to help us get along with other
people.

Admittedly, certain aspects of personal enrichment, especially spirituality and religion,
should be left for parents and churches to provide; after all, by advocating teachings of any
particular religion, public educators undermine our basic freedom of religion. Yet it is perfectly
appropriate, and useful, to inform students about various religious beliefs, customs and
institutions. Learning about different religions instills respect, tolerance, and understanding.

Moreover, students grow to appreciate certain fundamental virtues, such as compassion,
virtue, and humility, which all major religions share. Through this appreciation students grow
into adults who can work well together toward mutually agreed-upon goals.

In sum, it is chiefly through the more personally enriching Liberal studies that educators help
students fully blossom into well-rounded adults and successful workers. There will always be a
need to tram people for specific jobs, of course. However, since knowledge is advancing so
rapidly, employers and job-training programs are better equipped to provide this function,
leaving formal educators free to provide a broader, more personally enriching education that
will serve students throughout their lives and in any job or career.
