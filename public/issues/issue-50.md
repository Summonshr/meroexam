At various times in the geological past, many species have become extinct as a result of
natural, rather than human, processes. Thus, there is no justification for society to make
extraordinary efforts, especially at a great cost in money and jobs, to save endangered
species.

What are the limits of our duty to save endangered species from extinction? The statement
raises a variety of issues about morality, conscience, self-preservation, and economics. On
balance, however, I fundamentally agree with the notion that humans need not make
**extraordinary** efforts--at the expense of money and jobs--to ensure the preservation of any
endangered species.

As I see it, there are three fundamental arguments for imposing on ourselves at least some
responsibility to preserve endangered species. The first has to do culpability. According to this
argument, to the extent that endangerment is the result of anthropogenic events such as
dear-cutting of forests or polluting of lakes and streams, we humans have a duty to take
affirmative measures to protect the species whose survival we've placed in jeopardy.

The second argument has to do with capability. This argument disregards the extent to
which we humans might have contributed to the endangerment of a species. Instead, the
argument goes, if we are aware of the danger, know what steps are needed to prevent
extinction, and can take those steps, then we are morally obligated to help prevent extinction.

This argument would place a very high affirmative duty on humans to protect endangered
species.

The third argument is an appeal to self-preservation. The animal kingdom is an intricate
matrix of interdependent relationships, in which each species depends on many others for its
survival. Severing certain relationships, such as that between a predator and its natural prey,
can set into motion a series of extinctions that ultimately might endanger our own survival as a
species. While this claim might sound far-fetched to some, environmental experts assure us
that in the long run it is very real possibility.

On the other hand are two compelling arguments against placing a duty on humans to
protect endangered species. The first is essentially the Darwinian argument that extinction
results from the inexorable process of so-called “natural selection” in which stronger species
survive while weaker ones do not. Moreover, we humans are not exempt from the process.

Accordingly, if we see fit to eradicate other species in order to facilitate our survival, then so be
it. We are only behaving as animal must, Darwin would no doubt assert.

The second argument, and the one that I find most compelling, is an appeal to logic over
emotion. It is a scientific fact that thousands of animal species become extinct every year.

Many such extinctions are due to natural forces, while others are due to anthropogenic factors.

In any event, it is far beyond our ability to save them all. By what standard, then, should we
decide which species are worth saving and which ones are not? In my observation, we tend to
favor animals with human-like physical characteristics and behaviors. This preference is
understandable; after all, dolphins are far more endearing than bugs. But there is no logical
justification for such a standard. Accordingly, what makes more sense is to decide based on
our own economic self-interest. In other words, the more money and jobs it would cost to save
a certain species, the lower priority we should place on doing do.

In sum, the issue of endangered-species protection is a complex one, requiring subjective
judgments about moral duty and the comparative value of various life forms. Thus, there are
no easy or certain answers. Yet it is for this very reason I agree that economic self-interest
should take precedence over vague notions about moral duty when it comes to saving
endangered species. In the final analysis, at a point when it becomes critical for our own
survival as a species to save certain others, then we humans will do so if we are fit – in
accordance with Darwin’s observed process of natural selection.
