**Most people recognize the benefits of individuality, but the fact is that personal economic
success requires conformity.**

Personal economic success might be due either to one's investment strategy or to one's
work or career. With respect to the former, non-conformists with enough risk tolerance and
patience invariably achieve more success than conformists. With respect to the latter, while
non-conformists are more likely to succeed in newer industries where markets and technology
are in constant flux, conformists are more likely to succeed in traditional service industries
ensconced in systems and regulations.

Regarding the sort of economic success that results from investing one's wealth, the
principles of investing dictate that those who seek risky investments in areas that are out of
favor with the majority of investors ultimately reap higher returns than those who follow the
crowd. It is conformists who invest, along with most other investors, in areas that are currently
the most profitable, and popular. However, popular investments tend to be overpriced, and in
the long run their values will come down to reasonable levels. As a result, given enough time
conformists tend to reap lower rewards from their investments than nonconformists do.

Turning to the sort of economic success that one achieves by way of one's work, neither
conformists nor non-conformists necessarily achieve greater success than the other group. In
consumer-driven industries, where innovation, product differentiation and creativity are crucial
to lasting success, non-conformists who take unique approaches tend to recognize emerging
trends and to rise above their peers. For example, Ted Tumer's departure from the traditional
format of the other television networks, and the responsiveness of Amazon's Jeff Bezos to
burgeoning Internet commerce, propelled these two non-conformists into leadership positions
in their industries. Particularly in technology industries, where there are no conventional
practices or ways of thinking to begin with, people who cling to last year's paradigm, or to the
status quo in general, are soon left behind by coworkers and competing firms.

However, in traditional service industries--such as fnance, accounting, insurance, legal
services, and health care--personal economic success comes not to non-conformists but
rather to those who can work most effectively within the constraints of established practices,
policies and regulations. Of course, a clever idea for structuring a deal, or a creative legal
maneuver, might play a role in winning smaller battles along the way. But such tac-tics are
those of conformists who are playing by the same ground rules as their peers; winners are just
better at the game.

In conclusion, non-conformists with sufficient risk tolerance and patience are invariably the
most successful investors in the long run. When it comes to careers, however, while
non-conformists tend to be more successful in technology- and consumer-driven industries,
traditionalists are the winners in system-driven industries pervaded by policy, regulation, and
bureaucracy.
