**The best way to teach---whether as an educator, employer, or parent---is to praise positive
actions and ignore negative ones.
**

The speaker suggests that the most effective way to teach others is to praise positive
actions while ignoring negative ones. In my view, this statement is too extreme. It overlooks
circumstances under which praise might be inappropriate, as well as ignoring the beneficial
value of constructive criticism, and sometimes even punishment.

The recommendation that parents, teachers, and employers praise positive actions is
generally good advice. For young children positive reinforcement is critical in the development
of healthy self-esteem and self-confidence. For students appropriate positive feedback serves
as a motivating force, which spurs them on to greater academic achievement. For employees,
appropriately administered praise enhances productivity and employee loyalty, and makes for
a more congenial and pleasant work environment overall.

While recommending praise for positive actions is fundamentally sound advice, this advice
should carry with it certain caveats. First, some employees and older students might fred
excessive praise to be patronizing or paternalistic. Secondly, some individuals need and
respond more appropriately to praise than others; those administering the praise should be
sensitive to the individual's need for positive reinforcement in the fzrst place. Thirdly, praise
should be administered fairly and evenhandedly. By issuing more praise to one student than to
others, a teacher might cause one recipient to be labeled by classmates as teacher's pet, even
if the praise is well deserved or badly needed. If the result is to alienate other students, then
the praise might not be justified. Similarly, at the workplace a supervisor must be careful to
issue praise fairly and evenhandedly, or risk accusations of undue favoritism, or even
discrimination.

As for ignoring negative actions, I agree that minor peccadilloes can, and in many cases
should, be overlooked. Mistakes and other negative actions are often part of the natural
learning process. Young children are naturally curious, and parents should not scold their
children for every broken plate or precocious act. Otherwise, children do not develop a healthy
sense of wonder and curiosity, and will not learn what they must in order to make their own
way in the world. Teachers should avoid rebuking or punishing students for faulty reasoning,
incorrect responses to questions, and so forth. Otherwise, students might stop trying to learn
altogether. And employees who know they are being monitored closely for any sign of errant
behavior are likely to be less productive, more resentful of their supervisors, and less loyal to
their employers.

At the same time, some measure of constructive criticism and critique, and sometimes even
punishment, is appropriate. Parents must not turn a blind eye to their child's behavior if it
jeopardizes the child's physical safety or the safety of others. Teachers should not ignore
behavior that unduly disrupts the learning process; and of course teachers should correct and
critique students' class work, homework and tests as needed to help the students learn from
their mistakes and avoid repeating them. Finally, employers must not permit employee
behavior that amounts to harassment or that otherwise undermines the overall productivity at
the workplace. Acquiescence in these sorts of behaviors only serves to sanction them.

To sum up, the speaker's dual recommendation is too extreme. Both praise and criticism
serve useful purposes in promoting a child's development, a student's education, and an
employee's loyalty and productivity. Yet both must be appropriately and evenhandedly
administered; otherwise, they might serve instead to defeat these purposes.
