Issue 40
---------------------------

In many countries it is now possible to turn on the television and view government at work.

Watching these proceedings can help people understand the issues that affect their lives. The
more kinds of government proceedings---trials, debates, meetings, etc.---that are televised,
the more society will benefit.

I strongly agree that the more government proceedings--debates, meeting, and so
forth---that are televised, the more society will benefit overall. Nevertheless, undue emphasis
on this means of informing a constituency has the potential for harm--which any society must
take care not to allow.

Access to government proceedings via television carries several significant benefits. The
main benefit lies in two useful archival functions of videotaped proceedings. First, videotapes
are valuable supplements to conventional means of record keeping. Although written
transcripts and audio tapes might provide an accurate record of what is said, only video tapes
can convey the body language and other visual clues that help us understand what people say,
whether they are being disingenuous, sarcastic, or sincere. Secondly, videotape archives
provide a useful catalogue for documentary journalists.

Televised proceedings also provide three other useful functions. First, for shut-ins and people
who live in remote regions, it might be impracticable, or even impossible, to view government
proceedings in person. Secondly, with satellite television systems it is possible to witness the
governments of other cities, states, and even nations at work. This sort of exposure provides
the viewer a valuable sense of perspective, an appreciation for other forms of government, and
so forth. Thirdly, in high schools and universities, television proceedings can be useful
curriculum supplements for students of government, public policy, law, and even public
speaking.

Nevertheless, televising more and more government proceedings carries certain risks that
should not be ignored. Watching televised government proceedings is inherently a rather
passive experience. The viewer cannot voice his or her opinions, objections, or otherwise
contribute to what is being viewed. Watching televised proceedings as a substitute for active
participation in the political process can, on a mass scale, undermine the democratic process
by way of its chilling effect on participation. Undue emphasis on tele government poses the risk
that government proceedings will become mere displays, or shows, for the public, intended as
public relations ploys and so-called **photo opportunities,** while the true business of
government is moved behind closed doors.

In sum, readier access to the day-day business of a government can only serve to inform
and educate. Although undue reliance on televised proceedings for information can quell
active involvement and serve as a censor for people being televised, I think these are risks
worth taking in the interest of disclosure.
