**People work more productively in teams than individually. Teamwork requires cooperation,
which motivates people much more than individual competition does.**

The speaker asserts that because teamwork requires cooperative effort, people are more
motivated and therefore more productive working in teams than working individually as
competitors. My view is that this assertion is true only in some cases. If one examines the
business world, for example, it becomes clear that which approach is more effective in
motivating people and in achieving productivity depends on the specific job.

In some jobs productivity dearly depends on the ability of coworkers to cooperate as
members of a team. For businesses involved in the production of products through complex
processes, all departments and divisions must work in lock-step fashion toward product
roll-out. Cooperative interaction is even essential in jobs performed in relative isolation and in
jobs in which technical knowledge or ability, not the ability to work with others, would seem to
be most important. For example, scientists, researchers, and even computer programmers
must collaborate to establish common goals, coordinate efforts, and meet time lines. Moreover,
the kinds of people attracted to these jobs in the first place are likely to be motivated by a
sense of common purpose rather than by individual ambition.

In other types of jobs individual competition, tenacity, and ambition are the keys to
productivity. For example, a commissioned salesperson's compensation, and sometimes
tenure and potential for promotion as well, is based on comparative sales performance of
coworkers. Working as competitors a firm's individual salespeople maximize productivity-in
terms of profit--both for themselves and for their finn. Key leadership positions also call, above
all, for a certain tenacity and competitive spirit. A finn's founding entrepreneur must maintain
this spirit in order for the firm to survive, let alone to maximize productivity. Moreover, in my
observation the kinds of people inclined toward entrepreneurship and sales in the first place
are those who are competitive by nature, not those who are motivated primarily by a sense of
common purpose.

On balance, however, my view is that cooperation is more crucial for an organization's
long-term productivity than individual competition. Even in jobs where individual
competitiveness is part-and-parcel of the job, the importance of cooperation should not be
underestimated. Competition among sales people can quickly grow into jealousy, back
stabbing, and unethical behavior all of which are counterproductive. And even the most
successful entrepreneurs would no doubt admit that without the cooperative efforts of their
subordinates, partners, and colleagues, their personal visions would never become reality.

In sum, individual competitiveness and ambition are essential motivating forces for certain
types of jobs, while in other jobs it is a common sense of mission that motivates workers to
achieve maximum productivity. In the final analysis, however, the overall productivity of almost
every organization depends ultimately on the ability of its members to cooperate as a team.
