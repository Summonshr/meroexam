People who are the most deeply committed to an idea or policy are the most critical of it.

The speaker claims that people who are the most fmnly committed to an idea or policy are
the same people who are most critical of that idea or policy. While I find this claim paradoxical
on its face, the paradox is explainable, and the explanation is well supported empirically.

Nevertheless, the claim is an unfair generalization in that it fails to account for other empirical
evidence serving to discredit it.

A threshold problem with the speaker's claim is that its internal logic is questionable. At first
impression it would seem that firm commitment to an idea or policy necessarily requires the
utmost confidence in it, and yet one cannot have a great deal of confidence in an idea or policy
if one recognizes its flaws, drawbacks, or other problems. Thus commitment and criticism
would seem to be mutually exclusive. But are they? One possible explanation for the paradox
is that individuals most fmnly committed to an idea or policy are often the same people who
are most knowledgeable on the subject, and therefore are in the best position to understand
and appreciate the problems with the idea or policy.

Lending credence to this explanation for the paradoxical nature of the speaker's claim are
the many historical cases of uneasy marriages between commitment to and criticism of the
same idea or policy. For example, Edward Teller, the so-called **father of the atom bomb,** was
firmly committed to America's policy of gaining military superiority over the Japanese and the
Germans; yet at the same time he attempted fervently to dissuade the U.S. military from
employing his technology for destruction, while becoming the most visible advocate for various
peaceful and productive applications of atomic energy. Another example is George
Washington, who was quoted as saying that all the world's denizens **should abhor war
wherever they may find it.** Yet this was the same military general who played a key role in the
Revolutionary War between Britain and the States. A third example was Einstein, who while
committed to the mathematical soundness of his theories about relativity could not reconcile
them with the equally compelling quantum theory which emerged later in Einstein's life. In fact,
Einstein spent the last twenty years of his life criticizing his own theories and struggling to
determine how to reconcile them with newer theories.

In the face of historical examples supporting the speaker's claim are innumerable influential
individuals who were zealously committed to certain ideas and policies but who were not
critical of them, at least not outwardly. Could anyone honestly claim, for instance, that
Elizabeth Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who in the late 19th Century paved the way for the
women's rights movement by way of their fervent advocacy, were at the same time highly
critical or suspicious of the notion that women deserve equal rights under the law? Also, would
it not be absurd to claim that Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, history's two leading
advocates of civil disobedience as a means to social reform, had serious doubts about the
ideals to which they were so demonstrably committed? Finally, consider the two ideologues
and revolutionaries Lenin and Mussolini. Is it even plausible that their demonstrated
commitment to their own Communist and Fascist policies, respectively, belied some deep
personal suspicion about the merits of these policies? To my knowledge no private writing of
any of these historical figures lends any support to the claim that these leaders were
particularly critical of their own ideas or policies.

To sum up, while at first glance a deep commitment to and incisive criticism of the same idea
or policy would seem mutually exclusive, it appears they are not. Thus the speaker's claim has
some merit. Nevertheless, for every historical case supporting the speaker's claim are many
others serving to refute it. In the final analysis, then, the correctness of the speaker's assertion
must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
