Sometimes imagination is a more valuable asset than experience. People who lack
experience are free to imagine what is possible and thus can approach a task without
constraints of established habits and attitudes.

The speaker asserts that imagination is **sometimes** more valuable than experience
because individuals who lack experience can more freely imagine possibilities for approaching
tasks than those entrenched in established habits and attitudes. I fundamentally agree;
however, as the speaker implies, it is important not to overstate the comparative value of
imagination. Examples from the arts and the sciences aptly illustrate both the speaker's point
and my caveat.

One need only observe young children as they go about their daily lives to appreciate the
role that pure imagination can play as an aid to accomplishing tasks. Young children, by virtue
of their lack of experience, can provide insights and valuable approaches to adult problems.

Recall the movie Big, in which a young boy magically transformed into an adult found himself
in a high-power job as a marketing executive. His inexperience in the adult world of business
allowed his youthful imagination free reign to contribute creative--and successful ideas that
none of his adult colleagues, set in their ways of thinking about how businesses go about
maximizing profits, ever would have considered. Admittedly, Big was a fictional account; yet, I
think it accurately portrays the extent to which adults lack the kind of imagination that only
inexperience can bring to solving many adult problems.

The speaker's contention also finds ample empirical support in certain forms of artistic
accomplishment and scientific invention. History is replete with evidence that our most gifted
musical composers are young, relatively inexperienced, individuals. Notables ranging from
Mozart to McCartney come immediately to mind. Similarly, the wide-eyed wonder of
inexperience seems to spur scientific innovation. Consider the science fiction writer Jules
Veme, who through pure imagination devised highly specific methods and means for
transporting humans to outer space. What makes his imaginings so remarkable is that the
actual methods and means for space flight, which engineers settled on through the experience
of extensive research and trial-and-error, turned out to be essentially the same ones Verne had
imagined nearly a century earlier!
Of course, there are many notable exceptions to the rule that imagination unfettered by
experience breeds remarkable insights and accomplishments. Duke EUington, perhaps jazz
music's most prolific composers, continued to create new compositions until late in life.

Thomas Edition, who registered far more patents with the U.S. patent office than any other
person, continued to invent until a very old age. Yet, these are exceptions to the general
pattern. Moreover, the later accomplishments of individuals such as these tend to build on
earlier ones, and therefore are not as truly inspired as the earlier ones, which sprung from
imagination less fettered by life experience.

On the other hand, it is important not to take this assertion about artistic and scientific
accomplishment too far. Students of the arts, for instance, must learn theories and techniques,
which they then apply to their craft whether music performance, dance, or acting. And,
creative writing requires the cognitive ability to understand how language is used and how to
communicate ideas. Besides, creative ability is itself partly a function of intellect; that is,
creative expression is a marriage of one's cognitive abilities and the expression of one's
feelings and emotions. In literature, for example, a rich life experience from which to draw
ideas is just as crucial to great achievement as imagination. For example, many critics laud
Mark Twam's autobiography, which he wrote on his death bed, as his most inspired work. And,
while the direction and goals of scientific research rely on the imaginations of key individuals,
most scientific discoveries and inventions come about not by sudden epiphanies of youthful
star-gazers but rather by years and years of trial-and-error in corporate research laboratories.

In sum, imagination can serve as an important catalyst for artistic creativity and scientific
invention. Yet, experience can also play a key role; in fact, in literature and in science it can
play just as key a role as the sort of imagination that inexperience breeds.
