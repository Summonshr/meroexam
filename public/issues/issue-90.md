We live under the illusion that we know what we want, when actually we merely want what we
are supposed to want.

I strongly disagree that personality is the key to how a student or scholar interprets the
material with which he or she works. Whether those materials be facts, events, data, or
observations, in my view the key factor in their interpretation is a person's training and
educational background.

Assuming that by personality the speaker embraces such personal attributes as individual
temperament, disposition and general mood, and outlook, it seems to me that personality has
little bearing on how students and scholars interpret the materials with which they work.

Admittedly, whether an individual tends to be an optimist or a pessimist might have some
beating on interpretation. For instance, an archeology student with a generally sanguine
outlook toward life might respond to a lengthy yet unsuccessful search for certain artifacts as
discovery and progress--insofar as certain possibilities have been eliminated, bringing us
closer to affirmative discoveries. In contrast, an archeology student with a generally
pessimistic outlook might condude that the same effort was in vain and that nothing has been
learned or otherwise gained. Yet it strikes me that these reactions are emotional ones that
have nothing to do with intellectual interpretation.

In sharp contrast, one's educational background and training can serve as a strong influence
on how one interprets historical events involving human affairs, statistical data, and especially
art. With respect to human affairs, consider the centuries-old imperialist policies of Great
Britain. A student of political science might interpret British imperialism as a manifestation of
that nation's desire for political power and domination over others. A student of economics
might see it as a strategy to gain control over economic resources and distribution channels for
goods. A sociology or anthropology student might see it as an assimilation of culture. And, a
student of theology or religion might interpret the same phenomenon as an attempt, well
intentioned or otherwise, to proselytize and to impose certain beliefs, rituals, and customs on
others.

Educational training and background also affects how students and scholars interpret
seemingly objective statistical data. It is crucial here to distinguish between numbers
themselves, which are not subject to varying interpretations, from what the numbers
signify--that is, what conclusions, prescriptions, or lessons we might come away with. Consider,
for example, a hypothetical increase in the rate of juvenile crime in a particular city. Although
the percent change itself might be subject to only one reasonable meaning, what the change
signifies is open to various interpretations. A sociologist might interpret this data as an
indication of deteriorating family unit or community. A student of public policy or government
might see this statistic as an indication that current legislation fails to implement public policy
as effectively as it could. And a student of law or criminal justice might interpret the same
statistic as a sign of overburdened courts or juvenile detention facilities.

Finally, when it comes to how students and scholars interpret art, training and educational
background play an especially significant role. After all, while facts and figures are to some
extent objective, the meaning Of art is an inherently subjective, and highly personal, matter. A
business student might interpret a series of art works as attempts by the artist to produce
viable products for sale in the marketplace. However, a theology student might eschew such a
cold and cynical interpretation, seeing instead an expression of praise, a celebration of life, a
plea for grace, or a struggle to come to terms with mortality. Even art students and scholars
can interpret the same art differently, depending on their training. A student of art history might
see a particular work as the product of certain artistic influences, while a student of art theory,
composition, and technique might view the same work as an attempt to combine color foi
visual impact, or as an experiment with certain brush-stroke techniques.

To sum up, I concede that as students and scholars our working **materials**--facts, data,
objects, and events--are open to subjective interpretation in terms of what they teach us.

However, what our materials teach us is a function of what we've already learned, and has little
if anything to do with our personal basket of emotions and moods called **personality.
