As we acquire more knowledge, things do not become more comprehensible, but more
complex and more mysterious.

Does knowledge render things more comprehensible, or more complex and mysterious? In
my view the acquisition of knowledge brings about all three at the same time. This paradoxical
result is aptly explained and illustrated by a number of advances in our scientific knowledge.

Consider, for example, the sonar system on which blind bats rely to navigate and especially
to seek prey. Researchers have learned that this system is startlingly sophisticated. By
emitting audible sounds, then processing the returning echoes, a bat can determine in a
nanosecond not only how far away its moving prey is but also the prey's speed, direction, size
and even specie! This knowledge acquired helps explain, of course, how bats navigate and
survive. Yet at the same time this knowledge points out the incredible complexity of the
auditory and brain functions of certain animals, even of mere humans, and creates a certain
mystery and wonder about how such systems ever evolved organically.

Or consider our knowledge of the universe. Advances in telescope and space-exploration
technology seem to corroborate the theory of a continually expanding universe that began at
the very beginning of time with a **big bang.** On one level this knowledge, assuming it qualifies
as such, helps us comprehend our place in the universe and our ultimate destiny. Yet on the
other hand it adds yet another chapter to the mystery about what existed before time and the
universe.

Or consider the area of atomic physics. The naked human eye perceives very little, of
course, of the complexity of matter. To our distant ancestors the physical world appeared
simple--seemingly comprehensible by means of sight and touch. Then by way of scientific
knowledge we learned that all matter is comprised of atoms, which are further comprised of
protons, neutrons, and electrons. Then we discovered an even more basic unit of matter called
the quark. And now a new so-called **string** theory posits the existence of an even more
fundamental, and universal, unit of matter. On the one hand, these discoveries have rendered
things more comprehensible, by explaining and reconciling empirical observations of how
matter behaves. The string theory also reconciles the discrepancy between the quantum and
wave theories of physics. On the other hand, each discovery has in turn revealed that matter is
more complex than previously thought. In fact, the string theory, which is theoretically sound,
calls for seven more dimensions---in addition to the three we already know about! I'm
hard-pressed to imagine anything more complex or mysterious.

In sum, the statement overlooks a paradox about knowledge acquired, at least when it
comes to understanding the physical world. When through knowledge a thing becomes more
comprehensible and explainable we realize at the same time that it is more complex and
mysterious than previously thought.
