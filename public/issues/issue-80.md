The surest indicator of a great nation is not the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists,
but the general welfare of all its people.


The speaker claims that great advances in knowledge necessarily involve rejection of
authority. To the extent that political authority impedes such advances, I agree with this claim.

Otherwise, in my view most advances in knowledge actually embrace certain forms of authority,
rather than rejecting authority out of hand.

One striking example of how political authority can impede the advancement of knowledge
involves what we know about the age and evolution of planet Earth. In earlier centuries the
official Church of England called for a literal interpretation of the Bible, according to which the
Earth's age is determined to be about 6,000 years. IfWestern thinkers had continued to yield to
the ostensible authority of the Church, the fields of structural and historical geology would
never have advanced beyond the blind acceptance of this contention as fact.

A more modern example of how yielding to political authority can impede the advancement
of knowledge involves the Soviet Refusenik movement of the 1920s. During this time period
the Soviet government attempted not only to control the direction and the goals of its scientists'
research but also to distort the outcome of that research. During the 1920s the Soviet
government quashed certain areas of scientific inquiry, destroyed entire research facilities and
libraries, and caused the sudden disappearance of many scientists who were engaged in
research that the state viewed as a potential threat to its power and authority. Not surprisingly,
during this time period no significant advances in scientific knowledge occurred under the
auspices of the Soviet government.

However, given a political climate that facilitates free thought and honest intellectual inquiry,
great advances in knowledge can be made by actually embracing certain forms of **authority.**
A good example involves modern computer technology. Only by building on, or embracing,
certain well-established laws of physics were engineers able to develop silicon-based
semi-conductor technology. Although new biotechnology research suggests that organic,
biochemical processors will replace artificial semi-conductors as the computers of the future, it
would be inappropriate to characterize this leap in knowledge as a rejection of authority.

In sum, to the extent that political authority imposes artificial constraints on knowledge, I
agree that advances in knowledge might require rejection of authority. Otherwise, in my
observation advances in knowledge more typically embrace and build on authoritative
scientific principles and laws, and do not require the rejection of any type of authority.
