Most people prefer restrictions and regulations to absolute freedom of choice, even though
they might deny such a preference.


Do people prefer constraints on absolute freedom of choice, regardless of what they might
claim? I believe so, because in order for any democratic society to thrive it must strike a
balance between freedom and order.

History informs us that attempts to quell basic individual freedoms--of expression, of opinion
and belief, and to come and go as we please invariably fail. People ultimately rise up against
unreasonable constraints on freedom of choice. The desire for freedom seems to spring from
our fundamental nature as human beings. But does this mean that people would prefer
absolute freedom of choice to any constraints whatsoever? No. Reasonable constraints on
freedom are needed to protect freedom--and to prevent a society from devolving into a state of
anarchy where life is short and brutish.

To appreciate our preference for constraining our own freedom of choice, one need look no
further than the neighborhood playground. Even without any adult supervision, a group of
youngsters at play invariably establish mutually agreed-upon rules for conduct-- whether or not
a sport or game is involved. Children learn at an early age that without any rules for behavior
the playground bully usually prevails. And short of beating up on others, bullies enjoy taking
prisoners--i.e., restricting the freedom of choice of others. Thus our preference for constraining
our freedom of choice stems from our desire to protect and preserve that freedom.

Our preference for constraining our own freedom of choice continues into our adult lives. We
freely enter into exclusive pair-bonding relationships; during our teens we agree to **go steady,**
then as adults we voluntarily enter into marriage contracts. Most of us eagerly enter into
exclusive employment relationships--preferring the security of steady income to the **freedom**
of not knowing where our next paycheck will come from. Even people who prefer
self-employment to job security quickly learn that the only way to preserve their **autonomy** is
to constrain themselves in terms of their agreements with clients and customers, and
especially in terms of how they use their time. Admittedly, our self-inflicted job constraints are
born largely of economic necessity. Yet even the wealthiest individuals usually choose to
constrain their freedom by devoting most of their time and attention to a few pet projects.

Our preference for constraining our own freedom of choice is evident on a societal level as
well. Just as children at a playground recognize the need for self-imposed rules and
regulations, as a society we recognize the same need. After all, in a democratic society our
system of laws is an invention of the people. For example, we insist on being bound by rules
for operating motor vehicles, for buying and selling both real and personal property, and for
making public statements about other people. Without these rules, we would live in continual
fear for our physical safety, the security of our property, and our personal reputation and
dignity.

In sum, I agree with the fundamental assertion that people prefer reasonable constraints on
their freedom of choice. In fact, in a democratic society we insist on imposing these constraints
on ourselves in order to preserve that freedom.
