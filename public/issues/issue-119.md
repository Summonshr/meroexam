Although innovations such as video, computers, and the Internet seem to offer schools
improved methods for instructing students, these technologies all too often distract from real
learning.


The speaker asserts that innovations such as videos, computers, and the Internet too often
distract from **real** learning in the dassroom. I strongly agree that these tools can be
counterproductive in some instances, and ineffectual for certain types of learning.

Nevertheless, the speaker's assertion places too little value on the ways in which these
innovations can facilitate the learning process.

In several respects, I find the statement compelling. First of all, in my observation and
experience, computers and videos are misused most often for education when teachers rely
on them as surrogates, or baby-sitters. Teachers must use the time during which students are
watching videos or are at their computer stations productively--helping other students,
preparing lesson plans, and so forth. Otherwise, these tools can indeed impede the learning
process.

Secondly, passive viewing of videos or of Web pages is no indication that any significant
learning is taking place. Thus teachers must carefully select Internet resources that provide a
true interactive learning experience, or are highly informative otherwise. And, in selecting
videos teachers must be sure to follow up with lively class discussions. Otherwise, the
comparatively passive nature of these media can render them ineffectual in the learning
process.

Thirdly, some types of learning occur best during face-to-face encounters between teacher
and student, and between students. Only by way of a live encounter can a language teacher
recognize and immediately correct subtle problems in pronunciauon and inflection. And, there
is no suitable substitute for a live encounter when it comes to teaching techniques in painting,
sculpture, music performance, and acting. Moreover, certain types of learning are facilitated
when students interact as a group. Many grade school teachers, for example, find that reading
together aloud is the most effective way for students to learn this skill.

Fourth, with technology-based learning tools, especially computers and the Intemet,
learning how to use the technology can rob the teacher of valuable time that could be spent
accomplishing the teacher's ultimate educational objectives. Besides, any technology-based
learning tool carries the risk of technical problems. Students whose teachers fail to plan for
productive use of unexpected down-time can lose opportunities for real learning.

Finally, we must not overlook the non-quantifiable benefit that personal attention can afford.

A human teacher can provide meaningful personal encouragement and support, and can
identify and help to solve a student's social or psychological problems that might be impeding
the learning process. No video, computer program, or Web site can begin to serve these
invaluable functions.

Acknowledging the many ways that technological innovations can impede **real** learning,
these innovations nevertheless can facilitate **real** learning, if employed judicially and for
appropriate purposes. Specifically, when it comes to learning rote facts and figures, personal
interaction with a teacher is unnecessary, and can even result in fatigue and burnout for the
teacher. Computers are an ideal tool for the sorts of learning that occur only through
repetition--typing skills, basic arithmetical calculations, and so forth. Computers also make
possible visual effects that aid uniquely in the learning of spatial concepts. Finally, computers,
videos and the Internet are ideal for imparting basic text-book information to students, thereby
freeing up the teacher's time to give students individualized attention.

In sum, computers and videos can indeed distract from learning--when teachers misuse
them as substitutes for personal attention, or when the technology itself becomes the focus of
attention. Nevertheless, if judicially used as primers, as supplements, and where repetition and
rote learning are appropriate, these tools can serve to liberate teachers to focus on individual
needs of students--needs that only **real** teachers can recognize and meet.
