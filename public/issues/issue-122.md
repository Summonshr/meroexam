**Conformity almost always leads to a deadening of individual creativity and energy.**


This statement about the impact of conformity on individual energy and creativity actually
involves two distinct issues. In my view, the extent to which conformity stifles a person's
energy depends primarily on the temperament of each individual, as well as on the goals
toward which the person's energy is directed. However, I am in full agreement that conformity
stifles creativity; indeed, in my view the two phenomena are mutually exdusive.

Whether conformity stifles individual energy depends on the individual person involved.

Some people are conformists by nature. By this I mean that they function best in an
environment where their role is dearly defined and where teamwork is key in meeting group
objectives. For conformists individual energy comes from sharing a common purpose, or
mission, with a group that must work in lock-step fashion to achieve that mission. In the military
and in team sports, for example, the group's common mission is dearly understood, and group
members conform to the same dress code, drill regimen, and so forth. And rather than quelling
energy, this conformity breeds camaraderie, as well as enthusiasm and even fervor for winning
the battle or the game. Besides, nonconforming behavior in these environments only serves to
undermine success; if game plans or battle strategies were left to each individual team
member, the results would dearly be disastrous.

Conformists find enhanced energy in certain corners of the business world as well,
particularly in traditional service industries such as finance, accounting, insurance, legal
services, and health care. In these businesses it is not the iconodasts who revel and thrive but
rather those who can work most effectively within the constraints of established practices,
policies, and regulations. Of course, a clever idea for structuring a deal, or a creative legal
maneuver, might play a role in winning smaller battles along the way. But such tactics are
those of conformists who are playing by the same ground rules as their peers.

In sharp contrast, other people are nonconformists by nature. These people are motivated
more often by the personal satisfaction that comes with creativity, invention, and innovation.

For these people a highly structured, bureaucratic environment only serves to quell motivation
and energy. Artists and musicians typically find such environments stifling, even noxious.

Entrepreneurial business people who thrive on innovation and differentiation are often driven
to self-employment because they feel stifled and frustrated, even offended, by a bureaucracy
which requires conformity.

As for whether conformity stifles individual creativity, one need only look around at the
individuals whom we consider highly creative to conclude that this is indeed the case. Our
most creative people are highly eccentric in their personal appearance, life-style, and so forth.

In fact, they seem to eschew any sort of established norms and mores. Bee-bop music pioneer
Thelonius Monk was renowned for his eccentric manner of speech, dress, and behavior. Even
as a young student, Frank Lloyd Wright took to carrying a cane and wearing a top hat and a
cape. And who could argue that musicians Prince and Michael Jackson, two of the most
creative forces in popular music, are nothing if not nonconforming in every way. Besides, by
definition creativity requires nonconformity. In other words, any creative act is necessarily in
nonconformance with what already exists.

To sum up, conformists find their energy by conforming, nonconformists by not conforming.

And creativity is the exclusive domain of the nonconformist.
