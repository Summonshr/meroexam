In any realm of life---whether academic, social, business, or political---the only way to
succeed is to take a practical, rather than an idealistic, point of view. Pragmatic behavior
guarantees survival, whereas idealistic views tend to be superceded by simpler, more
immediate options.

I agree with the speaker insofar as that a practical, pragmatic approach toward our endeavors
can help us survive in the short tenn. However, idealism is just as crucial if not more so--for
long-term success in any endeavor, whether it be in academics, business, or political and
social reform.

When it comes to academics, students who we would consider pragmatic tend not to pursue
an education for its own sake. Instead, they tend to cut whatever corners are needed to
optimize their grade average and survive the current academic term. But, is this approach the
only way to succeed academically? Certainly not. Students who eamesdy pursue intellectual
paths that truly interest them are more likely to come away with a meaningful and lasting
education. In fact, a sense of mission about one's area of fascination is strong motivation to
participate actively in class and to study earnesdy, both of which contribute to better grades in
that area. Thus, although the idealist-student might sacrifice a high overall grade average, the
depth of knowledge, academic discipline, and sense of purpose the student gains will serve
that student well later in life.

In considering the business world it might be more tempting to agree with the speaker; after
all, isn't business fundamentally about pragmatism--that is, **getting the job done** and paying
attention to the **bottom line**? Emphatically, no. Admittedly, the everyday machinations of
business are very much about meeting mundane short-term goals: deadlines for production,
sales quotas, profit margins, and so forth. Yet underpinning these activities is the vision of the
company's chief executive--a vision which might extend far beyond mere profit maximization to
the ways in which the frrm can make a lasting and meaningful contribution to the community, to
the broader economy, and to the society as a whole. Without a dream or vision--that is, without
strong idealist leadership--a firm can easily be cast about in the sea of commerce without dear
direction, threatening not only the fLrm's bottom line but also its very survival.

Finally, when it comes to the political arena, again at fzrst blush it might appear that
pragmatism is the best, if not the only, way to succeed. Most politicians seem driven by their
interest in being elected and reelected--that is, in surviving--rather than by any sense of
mission, or even obligation to their constituency or country. Diplomatic and legal maneuverings
and negotiations often appear intended to meet the practical needs of the parties
involved--minimizing costs, preserving options, and so forth. But, it is idealists-not
pragmatists--who sway the masses, incite revolutions, and make political ideology reality.

Consider idealists such as America's founders, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther IGng. Had
these idealists concerned themselves with short-term survival and immediate needs rather
than with their notions of an ideal society, the United States and India might still be British
colonies, and African-Americans might still be relegated to the backs of buses.

In short, the statement fails to recognize that idealism--keeping one's eye on an ultimate
prize--is the surest path to long-term success in any endeavor. Meeting one's immediate
needs, while arguably necessary for short-term survival, accomplishes litde without a sense of
mission, a vision, or a dream for the long term.
