Laws should not be stationary and fixed. Instead, they should be flexible enough to take
account of various circumstances, times, and places.

Does **originality** mean putting together old ideas in new ways, as the speaker contends,
rather than conjuring up truly new ideas? Although I agree that in various realms of human
endeavor, such as linguistics, law, and even the arts, so-called **new** or **original** ideas rarely
are. However, when it comes to the physical sciences originality more often entails chartering
completely new intellectual territory.

The notion that so-called **originality** is actually variation or synthesis of existing ideas finds
its greatest support in linguistics and in law. Regarding the former, in spite of the many words
in the modern English language that are unique to Western culture, modern English is derived
from, and builds upon, a variety of linguistic traditions--and ultimately from the ancient Greek
and Latin languages. Were we to insist on rejecting tradition in favor of purely modern
language we would have essentially nothing to say. The same holds true for all other modern
languages. As for law, consider the legal system in the United States, which is deeply rooted in
traditional English common-law principles of equity and justice. The system in the U.S.

requires that new, so-called **modern** laws be consistent with and indeed build upon--those
traditional principles.

Even in the arts--where one might think that true originality must surely reside--so-called
**new** ideas almost always embrace, apply, or synthesize what came earlier. For example,
most **modern** visual designs, forms, and elements are based on certain well-established
aesthetic ideals--such as symmetry, balance, and harmony. Admittedly, modern art works often
eschew these principles in favor of true originality. Yet, in my view the appeal of such works
lies primarily in their novelty and brashness. Once the ephemeral novelty or shock dissipates,
these works quickly lose their appeal because they violate fn:rnly established artistic ideals. An
even better example from the arts is modern rock-and-roll music, which upon first listening
might seem to bear no resemblance to dassical music traditions. Yet, both genres rely on the
same 12-note scale, the same notions of what harmonies are pleasing to the ear, the same
forms, the same rhythmic meters, and even many of the same melodies.

When it comes to the natural sciences, however, some new ideas are truly original while
others put established ideas together in new ways. One striking example of truly original
scientific advances involves what we know about the age and evolution of the Earth. In e~rlier
centuries the official Church of England called for a literal interpretation of the Bible, according
to which the Earth's age is determined to be about 6,000 years. If Western thinkers had simply
put these established ideas together in new ways the fields of structural and historical geology
might never have advanced further. A more recent example involves Einstein's theory of
relativity. Einstein theorized, and scientists have since proven empirically, that the pace of time,
and possibly the direction of time as well, is relative to the observer's motion through space.

This truth ran so contrary to our subjective, linear experience, and to previous notions about
time and space, that I think Einstein's theory can properly be characterized as truly original.

However, in other instances great advances in science are made by putting together current
theories or other ideas in new ways. For example, only by building on certain well-established
laws of physics were engineers able to develop silicon-based semiconductor technology. And,
only by struggling to reconcile the quantum and relativity theories have physicists now posited
a new so-called **string** theory, which puts together the two preexisting theories in a
completely new way.

To sum up, for the most part originality does not reject existing ideas but rather embraces,
applies, or synthesizes what came before. In fact, in our modern languages, our new laws, and
even our new art, existing ideas are reflected, not shunned. But, when it comes to science,
whether the speaker's claim is true must be determined on a case-by-case basis, with each
new theory or innovation.
