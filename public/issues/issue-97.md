The function of art is not to keep pace with science and technology but rather to provide an
escape from these forces.


I strongly disagree with this statement, on two counts. First, in my observation art embraces
the current state of science and technology more often than it rejects or opposes it. More
significantly, however, I find the speaker's suggestion that the function of art relates to science
and technology to be misguided.

In general, it would appear that art is more likely motivated by an interest in keeping pace
with science and technology than by a desire to break from it. Particularly in architecture,
where engineering is part-and-parcel of the art, new creations take full advantage of new
technologies. For example, the burgeoning sted industry of the Industrial Age made possible
for the first time the erection of skyscrapers. And rather than avoiding the technology,
architects embraced it. But did the artists who designed our modern office buildings view their
**function** as keeping pace with technology? Probably not. Instead, the technology simply
provided a larger canvas and an expanded array of tools with which to create their art.

Admittedly, the arts-and-crafts architectural movement during the late 19th Century was a
conscious reaction to the Industrial Age's influence on architectural processes and materials,
as well as the overly ornate Victorian style. However, this break from technology is the
historical exception to the rule. Besides, Frank Lloyd Wright, who championed the
arts-and-crafts style during the first half of the 20th Century, eagerly exploited many of the
building materials and engineering processes which new technology offered at the time.

Eagerness among artists to embrace new technology, as opposed to providing an escape
from it, is not limited to architecture. Much of modem abstract painting seems to convey a
boldness and daring that characterizes modern technological progress. And in contemporary
sculpture one finds the widespread use of the new materials of modern chemistry-from plastics
to synthetic fabrics. Again, however, to suggest that the **function** of modern abstract art or
contemporary sculpture is to keep pace with science seems wrongheaded. It makes far more
sense to view the relationship between art and science as one in which the technologies are
tools which artists use to augment their palettes.

Admittedly, some works of art would appear to reject, or at least provide a respite from,
science and technology. One example is the modern minimalist movement, which one might
interpret as a reaction against, or a break from, the increasingly complex modern industrial age.

However, I am hard-pressed to think of any other significant art form or movement that dearly
seemed motivated by a desire to break free of science and technology.

Moreover, the speaker's concern for whether art's function is to embrace or oppose science
and technology begs the question, for the final objective of art lies instead in its ability to
convey a society's values, ideals, and concerns. The pyramids and obelisks of the ancient
world, as well as the great cathedrals of Renaissance Europe, including the murals and
sculptures in and around them, reflected a societal preoccupation with transcending the
human condition. During the Medieval period the most important architectural form was the
castle, which reflected an overriding concern for military security during a time of relative
anarchy. During the 18th and 19th Centuries, an emerging genteel upper-middle class saw
itself reflected in the bourgeois themes of impressionists such as Renoir and Monet. The
machine-tooled art deco style of the early 20th Century reflected industrial society's penchant
for technological progress, while modern abstract art mirrors the frenetic world that has
resulted from that progress.

In sum, while I agree that art is indeed influenced by science and technology, this influence
is mainly in the materials and processes that science makes available to the artist. The final
objective of art, far from having any beating on science or technology per se, is to hold a mirror
up to the society in which the artist operates.
