**The human mind will always be superior to machines because machines are only tools of
human minds.**

This statement actually consists of a series of three related claims:
* machines are tools of human minds;
* human minds will always be superior to machines; and
* it is because
machines are human tools that human minds will always be superior to machines. While I
concede the fn:st claim, whether I agree with the other two claims depends partly on how one
defines **superiority,** and partly on how willing one is to humble oneself to the unknown future
scenarios.

The statement is clearly accurate insofar as machines are tools of human minds. After all,
would any machine even exist unless a human being invented it? Of course not. Moreover, I
would be hard-pressed to think of any machine that cannot be described as a tool. Even
machines designed to entertain or amuse us--for example, toy robots, cars and video games,
and novelty items--are in fact tools, which their inventors and promoters use for engaging in
commerce and the business of entertainment and amusement. And, the claim that a machine
can be an end in itself, without purpose or utilitarian function for humans whatsoever, is
dubious at best, since I cannot conjure up even a single example of any such machine. Thus
when we develop any sort of machine we always have some sort of end in mind a purpose for
that machine.

As for the statement's second claim, in certain respects machines are superior. We have
devised machines that perform number-crunching and other rote cerebral tasks with greater
accuracy and speed than human minds ever could. In fact, it is because we can devise
machines that are superior in these respects that we devise them--as our tools--to begin with.

However, if one defines superiority not in terms of competence in per-forming rote tasks but
rather in other ways, human minds are superior. Machines have no capacity for independent
thought, for making judgments based on normative considerations, or for developing
emotional responses to intellectual problems.

Up until now, the notion of human-made machines that develop the ability to think on their
own, and to develop so-called **emotional intelligence,** has been pure fiction. Besides, even in
fiction we humans ultimately prevail over such machines--as in the cases of Frankenstein's
monster and Hal, the computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Yet it seems presumptuous to
assert with confidence that humans will always maintain their superior status over their
machines. Recent advances in biotechnology, particularly in the area of human genome
research, suggest that within the 21st Century we'll witness machines that can learn to think on
their own, to repair and nurture themselves, to experience visceral sensations, and so forth. In
other words, machines will soon exhibit the traits to which we humans attribute our own
superiority.

In sum, because we devise machines in order that they may serve us, it is fair to
characterize machines as **tools of human minds.** And insofar as humans have the unique
capacity for independent thought, subjective judgment, and emotional response, it also seems
fair to claim superiority over our machines. Besides, should we ever become so clever a
species as to devise machines that can truly think for themselves and look out for their own
well-being, then query whether these machines of the future would be **machines** anymore.
