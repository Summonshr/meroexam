Facts are stubborn things. They cannot be altered by our wishes, our inclinations, or the
dictates of our passions.

Can we alter facts according to our wishes or inclinations? If by **facts** the speaker means
such phenomena as political, economic, social, or legal status quo, then I concede that we can
alter facts. The reason for this is that such systems are abstract constructs of our inclinations,
wishes, and passions to begin with. Otherwise, I strongly agree with the speaker that we
cannot alter facts. When it comes to certain aspect of our personal lives, and to historical
events and scientific truths, no measure of desire or even passion can change external reality.

On an individual level, we all engage in futile attempts to alter facts--by pretending that
certain things are not the way they are because they are inconsistent with our wishes or
personal interests. Psychologists refer to this psychological defensive mechanism, which
seems to be part of human nature, as **denial.** Consider curious pastimes such as
mind-reading, psychic healing, rituals that purportedly impart immortality, and other such
endeavors, which seems to transcend all cultures and periods of human history.

Understandably, we would all like to have the ability to alter the physical world, including
ourselves, as we see fit, or even to live forever by means of the sheer force of our will. Yet, not
one iota of scientific evidence lends support to the claim that any human being has ever had
any such ability.

Nor can we alter facts by virtue of our inclinations or passions when it comes to history.

Admittedly, no person can truly know any particular past that the person did not experience
firsthand. In this sense history is a construct, created for us by reporters, archivists, and
historians. Historical facts are therefore susceptible to interpretation, characterization, and of
course errors in commission and omission. This is not to say, however, that historical facts can
be altered by our inventing versions that suit our inclinations or wishes. In short, an historical
event is not rendered any less factual by either our ignorance or characterization of it.

Similarly, when it comes to science our wishes and desires ultimately yield to the
stubbornness of facts--by which I mean empirical scientific evidence and the laws and
principles of the physical world. Admittedly, in many cases it is difficult to distinguish between
scientific **fact** and mere **theory.** History is replete with examples of what were considered at
one time to be facts, but later disproved as incorrect theories. Yet it is telling that many such
obsolete theories were based on the subjective inclinations, desires, and wishes of theorists
and of the societies in which the theorists lived. For example, the notions of an Earth-centered
tmiverse and of linear time and space were both influenced by religious notions--that is, by
human wishes and passions. As our factual knowledge increased such theories ultimately give
way.

In sum, I agree that facts are indeed **stubborn things.** Understandably, all humans are
guilty of ignoring, overlooking, and misunderstanding facts--at least to some extent. After all,
human passion, desire, and individual bias and perspective are powerful influences when it
comes to what we believe to be true and factual. Moreover, the statement carries deep
epistemological implications regarding the nature of knowledge and truth, which I cannot begin
to adequately address here. Nevertheless, on a less abstract level the speaker is correct that
neither inclination, desire, nor passion, no matter how fervent, can alter that which is past or
beyond our physical control.
