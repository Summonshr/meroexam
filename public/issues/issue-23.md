Scholars and researchers should not be concerned with whether their work makes a
contribution to the larger society. It is more important that they pursue their individual interests,
however unusual or idiosyncratic those interests may seem.


Should academic scholars and researchers be free to pursue whatever avenues of inquiry
and research that interest them, no matter how unusual or idiosyncratic, as the speaker
asserts? Or should they strive instead to focus on those areas that are most likely to benefit
society? l strongly agree with the speaker, for three reasons.

First of all, who is to decide which areas of academic inquiry are worthwhile? Scholars
cannot be left to decide. Given a choice they will pursue their own idiosyncratic areas of
interest, and it is highly unlikely that all scholars could reach a fully informed consensus as to
what research areas would be most worthwhile. Nor can these decisions be left to regulators
and legislators, who would bring to bear their own quirky notions about what would be
worthwhile, and whose susceptibility to influence renders them untrustworthy in any event.

Secondly, by human nature we are motivated to pursue those activities in which we excel. To
compel scholars to focus only on certain areas would be to force many to waste their true
talents. For example, imagine relegating today's preeminent astrophysicist Stephen Hawking
to research the effectiveness of affirmative-action legislation in reducing workplace
discrimination. Admittedly, this example borders on hyperbole. Yet the aggregate effect of
realistic cases would be to waste the intellectual talents of our world's scholars and
researchers. Moreover, lacking genuine interest or motivation, a scholar would be unlikely to
contribute meaningfully to his or her **assigned** field of study.

Thirdly, it is **idiosyncratic** and **unusual** avenues of inquiry that lead to the greatest
contributions to society. Avenues of intellectual and scientific inquiry that break no new ground
amount to wasted time, talent, and other resources. History is laden with unusual claims by
scholars and researchers that turned out stunningly significant--that the sun lies at the center
of our universe, that time and space are relative concepts, that matter consists of discrete
particles, that humans evolved from other life forms, to name a few. One current area of
unusual research is terraforming---creating biological life and a habitable atmosphere where
none existed before. This unusual research area does not immediately address society's
pressing social problems. Yet in the longer term it might be necessary to colonize other planets
in order to ensure the survival of the human race; and after all, what could be a more
significant contribution to society than preventing its extinction?
Those who would oppose the speaker's assertion might point out that public universities
should not allow their faculty to indulge their personal intellectual fantasies at taxpayer
expense. Yet as long as our universities maintain strict procedures for peer review, pure
quackery cannot persist for very long. Other detractors might argue that in certain academic
areas, particularly the arts and humanities, research and intellectually inquiry amount to little
more than a personal quest for happiness or pleasure. This specious argument overlooks the
societal benefits afforded by appreciating and cultivating the arts. And, earnest study in the
humanities affords us wisdom to know what is best for society, and helps us understand and
approach societal problems more critically, creatively, and effectively. Thus despite the lack of
a tangible nexus between certain areas of intellectual inquiry and societal benefit, the nexus is
there nonetheless.

In sum, I agree that we should allow academic scholars nearly unfettered freedom of
intellectual inquiry and research within reasonable limits as determined by peer review.

Engaging one's individual talents in one's particular area of fascination is most likely to yield
advances, discoveries, and innovations that serve to make the world a better and more
interesting place in which to live.
