**The purpose of education should be to provide students with a value system, a standard, a
set of ideas---not to prepare them for a specific job.**

Should educators teach values or focus instead on preparing students for jobs? In my view
the two are not mutually exclusive. It is by helping students develop their own principles for
living, as well as by instilling in them certain fundamental values, that educators best prepare
young people for the world of work.

One reason for my viewpoint is that rote learning of facts, figures, and technical skills does
not help us determine which goals are worthwhile and whether the means of attaming those
goals are ethically or morally acceptable. In other words, strong values and ethical standards
are needed to determine how we can best put our rote knowledge to use in the working world.

Thus, by helping students develop a thoughtful, principled value system educators actually
help prepare students for jobs.

Another reason for my viewpoint lies in the fact that technology-driven industries account for
an ever4ncreasing portion of our jobs. As advances in technology continue to accelerate,
specific knowledge and skills needed for jobs will change more and more quickly. Thus it would
be a waste of our education system to focus on specific knowledge and job skills that might
soon become obsolete--at the expense of teaching values. It seems more appropriate today
for employers to provide the training our work force needs to perform their jobs, freeing up our
educators to help students develop guiding principles for their careers.

Besides helping students develop their own thoughtful value systems, educators should
instill in students certain basic values upon which any democratic society depends; otherwise,
our freedom to choose our own jobs and careers might not survive in the long term. These
values include principles of fairness and equity upon which our system of laws is based, as
well as the values of tolerance and respect when it comes to the viewpoints of others. It seems
to me that these basic values can best by instilled at an early age in a classroom setting,
where young students can work out their value systems as they interact with their peers.

Moreover, as students grow into working adults, practicing the basic values of fairness and
respect they learned as students serves them well in their jobs. At the workplace these values
manifest themselves in a worker's ability to cooperate, compromise, understand various
viewpoints, and appreciate the rights and duties of coworkers, supervisors, and subordinates.

This ability cannot help but serve any worker's career goals, as well as enhancing overall
workplace productivity.

Admittedly, values and behavioral standards specific to certain religions are best left to
parents and churches. After all, by advocating the values and teachings of any particular
religion public educators undermine our basic freedom of religion. However, by exposing
students to various religious beliefs, educators promote the values of respect and tolerance
when it comes to the viewpoints of others. Besides, in my observation certain fundamental
values--such as compassion, virtue, and humility--are common to all major religions. By
appreciating certain fundamental values that we should all hold in common, students are more
likely to grow into adults who can work together at the workplace toward mutually agreed-upon
goals.

In sum, only when educators help students develop their own principles for living, and when
they instill certain fundamental values, do young people grow into successful working adults.

Although there will always be a need to train people for specific jobs, in our technological
society where knowledge advances so rapidly, employers and job training programs are better
equipped to provide this function leaving formal educators to equip students with a moral
compass and ballast to prevent them from being tossed about aimlessly in a turbulent
vocational sea.
