**In this age of intensive media coverage, it is no longer possible for a society to regard any
woman or man as a hero. The reputation of anyone who is subjected to media scrutiny will
eventually be diminished.**

In general, I agree with the assertion that intense media scrutiny nearly always serves to
diminish the reputation of society's would-be heroes, for the chief reason that it seems to be
the nature of media to look for ways to demean public figures whether heroic or not.

Moreover, while in isolated cases our so-called heroes have vindicated themselves and
restored their reputations diminished by the media, in my observation these are exceptional
cases to the general rule that once slandered, the reputation of any public figure, hero or
otherwise, is forever tarnished.

The chief reason why I generally agree with the statement has to do with the forces that
motivate the media in the first place. The media generally consist of profit-seeking entities,
whose chief objective is to maximize profits for their shareholders or other owners. Moreover,
our corporate culture has sanctioned this objective by codifying it as a fiduciary obligation of
any corporate executive. For better or worse, in our society media viewers, readers, and
listeners find information about the misfortunes and misdeeds of others, especially heroic
public figures, far more compelling than information about their virtues and accomplishments.

In short, we love a good scandal. One need look no further than the newsstand, local television
news broadcast, or talk show to find ample evidence that this is the case. Thus in order to
maximize profits the media are simply giving the public what they demand scrutiny of heroic
public figures that serves to diminish their reputation.

A second reason why I fundamentally agree with the statement is that, again for better or
worse, intense media scrutiny raises a presumption, at least in the public's collective mind, that
their hero is guilty of some sort of character flaw or misdeed. This presumption is
understandable. After all, I think any demographic study would show that the vast majority of
people relying on mainstream media for their information lack the sort of critical-thinking skills
and objectivity to see beyond what the media feeds them, and to render a fair and fully
informed judgment about a public figure--heroic or otherwise.

A third reason for my agreement with the statement has to do with the longer-term fallout
from intense media scrutiny and the presumption discussed above. Once tarnished as a result
of intense media scrutiny, a person's reputation is forever besmirched, regardless of the merits
or motives of the scrutinizers. Those who disagree with this seemingly cynical viewpoint might
cite cases in which public figures whose reputations had been tarnished were ultimately
vindicated. For example, certain celebrities have successfully challenged rag sheets such as
the National Enquirer in the courts, winning large damage awards for libel. Yet in my
observation these are exceptional cases; besides, a damage award is no indication that the
public has expunged from its collective memory a perception that the fallen hero is guilty of the
alleged character flaw or peccadillo.

In sum, the statement is fundamentally correct. As long as the media are motivated by profit,
and as long as the public at large demands stories that serve to discredit, diminish, and
destroy reputations, the media will continue to harm whichever unfortunate individuals become
their cynosures. And the opportunity for vindication is little consolation in a society that seems
to thrive, and even feed, on watching heroes being knocked off their pedestals.
