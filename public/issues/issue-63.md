Because of television and worldwide computer connections, people can now become familiar
with a great many places that they have never visited. As a result, tourism will soon become
obsolete.

The speaker asserts that television and computer connectivity will soon render tourism
obsolete. I agree that these technologies might eventually serve to reduce travel for certain
purposes other than tourism. However, I strongly disagree that tourism will become obsolete,
or that it will even decline, as a result.

As for the claim that television will render tourism obsolete, we already have sufficient
empirical evidence that this will simply not happen. For nearly a half-century we have been
peering through our television sets at other countries and cultures; yet tourism is as popular
today as ever. In fact, tourism has been increasing sharply during the last decade, which has
seen the advent of television channels catering exclusively to our interest in other cultures and
countries. The more reasonable conclusion is that television has actually served to spark our
interest in visiting other places.

It is somewhat more tempting to accept the speaker's further claim that computer
connectivity will render tourism obsolete. However, the speaker unfairly assumes that the
purpose of tourism is simply to obtain information about other people and places. Were this the
case, I would entirely agree that the current information explosion spells the demise of tourism.

But, tourism is not primarily about gathering information. Instead, it is about sensory
experience--seeing and heating firsthand, even touching and smelling. Could anyone honestly
claim that seeing a picture or even an enhanced 3-D movie of the Swiss Alps serves as a
suitable substitute for riding a touting motorcycle along narrow roads traversing those
mountains? Surely not. The physical world is laden with a host of such delights that we
humans are compelled to experience firsthand as tourists.

Moreover, in my view tourism will continue to thrive for the same reason that people still go
out for dinner or to the movies: we all need to **get away** from our familiar routines and
surroundings from time to 6me. Will computer connectivity alter this basic need? Certainly not.

In short, tourism is a manifestation of a basic human need for variety and for exploration. This
basic need is why humans have come to inhabit every corner of the Earth, and will just as
surely inhabit other planets of the solar system.

In fact, computer connectivity might actually provide a boon for tourism. The costs of travel
and accommodations are likely to decrease due to Internet price competition. Even more
significantly, to the extent that the Internet enhances communication among the world's
denizens, our level of comfort and trust when it comes to dealing with people from other
cultures will only increase. As a result, many people who previously would not have felt safe or
secure traveling to strange lands will soon venture abroad with a new sense of confidence.

Admittedly, travel for purposes other than tourism might eventually decline, as the business
world becomes increasingly dependent on the Internet. Products that can be reduced to digital
**bits and bites** can now be shipped anywhere in the world without any human travel. And the
volume of business-related trips will surely decline in the future, as teleconferencing becomes
more readily available. To the extent that business travelers **play tourist** during business trips,
tourism will decline as a result. Yet it would be absurd to claim that these phenomena alone will
render tourism obsolete.

In sum, while business travel might decline as a result of global connectivity, tourism is likely
to increase as a result. Global connectivity, especially the Internet, can only pique our curiosity
about other peoples, cultures, and places. Tourism helps satisfy that curiosity, as well as
satisfying a fundamental human need to experience new things first-hand and to explore the
world.
