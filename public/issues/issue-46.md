**It is through the use of logic and of precise, careful measurement that we become aware of
our progress. Without such tools, we have no reference points to indicate how far we have
advanced or retreated.**

Do we need careful measurements and logic to determine whether and to what extent we
are progressing or regressing? I agree that in certain endeavors quantitative measurements
and logical analysis of data are essential for this purpose. However, in other realms objective
data provides little guidance for determining progress. My view applies to individuals as well as
society as a whole.

As for monitoring individual progress, the extent to which careful measurement and logical
analysis of data are required depends on the specific endeavor. In the area of personal finance,
objective measurements are critical. We might feel that we are advancing financially when we
buy a new car or a better home, or when our salary increases. Yet these signs of personal
economic success can be deceptive. Cars depreciate quickly in value, and residential real
estate must appreciate steadily to offset ownership expenses. Even a pay raise is no sure sign
of personal financial progress; if the raise fails to keep pace with the cost of living then the real
salary is actually in decline.

In the area of one's physical well-being, however, quantitative measurement might be useful
yet insufficient. Quantitative data such as blood pressure, cholesterol level, and body weight
are useful objective indicators of physical health. Yet quantitative measurement and logic can
only take us so far when it comes to physical well-being. Levels of physical discomfort and
pain, the most reliable indicators of physical well-being, cannot be quantified. And of course
our emotional and psychological well-being, which can have a profound impact on our physical
health, defy objective measurement altogether.

On a societal level, as on a personal level, the extent to which careful measurement and
logic are needed to determine progress depends on the endeavor. In macro-economics, as in
personal finance, objective measurements are critical. For example, a municipality, state, or
nation might sense that things are improving economically when its rate of unemployment
declines. Yet if new jobs are in poor-paying positions involving unskilled labor, this apparent
advance might actually be a retreat. And, a boom in retail sales might amount to regress if the
goods sold are manufactured by foreign firms, who benefit from the boom at the expense of
domestic business expansion. Technological progress also requires careful measurement.

Advances is computer technology can only be determined by such factors as processing and
transfer speeds, numbers ofinstaUations and users, amounts of data accessed, and so forth.

And, advances in biotechnology are determined by statistical measurements of the
effectiveness of new drugs and other treatments, and by demographic statistics regarding the
incidence of the ailments that the technology seeks to ameliorate.

In contrast, socio-political progress is less susceptible to objective measurement. For
instance, progress in social welfare might be measured by the number of homeless people,
incidence of domestic violence, or juvenile crime rate. Yet would an increase in the number of
single mothers on welfare indicate that our society is becoming more compassionate and
effective in helping its victims, or would it indicate regress by showing that our private sector
and education systems are failing? Moreover, when it comes to our legal system and to politics,
progress has little to do with numbers, or even logic. For example, to what extent, if any, would
more lenient gun ownership laws indicate progress, considering the competing interests of
individual freedom and pubic safety? Do anti-abortion laws indicate a sociological advance or
retreat? Or, when a political party gains greater control of a legislature by sweeping a particular
election, is this progress or regress?
In sum, although the statement has merit, it unfairly generalizes. In areas such as finance,
economics, and computing technology, all of which involve nothing but quantifiable data,
nothing but careful measurement and logic suffice to determine the extent of progress. In other
areas, such as health care and social welfare, determining progress requires both objective
measurement and subjective judgment. Finally, progress in politics and law is an entirely
subjective matter--depending on each individual's values, priorities, and interests.
