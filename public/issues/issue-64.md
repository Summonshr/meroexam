High-speed electronic communications media, such as electronic mail and television, tend to
prevent meaningful and thoughtful communication.

Do high-speed means of communication, particularly television and computers, tend to
prevent meaningful and thoughtful communication, as the speaker suggests? Although ample
empirical evidence suggests so with respect to television, the answer is far less dear when it
comes to communication via computers.

Few would argue that since its inception broadcast television has greatly enhanced
communication to the masses. The circulation of even the most widely read newspapers pales
compared to the number of viewers of popular television news programs. Yet traditional
television is a one-way communications medium, affording viewers no opportunity to engage
those so-called **talking heads** in dialogue or respond. Of course, there is nothing inherent
about television that prevents us from meaningful and thoughtful communication with each
other. In fact, in television's early days it was a fairly common occurrence for a family to gather
around the television together for their favorite show, then afterwards discuss among
themselves what they had seen and heard. Yet over time television has proven itself to serve
primarily as a baby-sitter for busy parents, and as an means of escape for those who wish to
avoid communicating with the people around them. Moreover, in the pursuit of profit, network
executives have determined over time that the most effective uses of the medium are for
fast-paced entertainment and advertising--whose messages are neither thoughtful nor
meaningful.

Do computers offer greater promise for thoughtful and reflective communication than
television? Emphatically, yes. After all, media such as email and the Web are interactive by
design. And the opportunity for two-way communication enhances the chances of meaningful
and thoughtful communication. Yet their potential begs the question: Do these media in fact
serve those ends? It is tempting to hasten that the answer is **yes** with respect to email; after
are, we've all heard stories about how email has facilitated reunions of families and old friends,
and new long-distance friendships and romances. Moreover, it would seem that two-way
written communication requires far more thought and reflection than verbal conversation.

Nevertheless, email is often used to avoid face-to-face encounters, and in practice is used as
a means of distributing quick memos. Thus on balance it appears that email serves as an
impediment, not an aide, to thoughtful and reflective communication.

With respect to Web-based communication, the myriad of educational sites, interactive and
otherwise, is strong evidence that the Web tends to enhance, rather than prevent, meaningful
communication. Distance learning courses made possible by the Web lend further credence to
this assertion. Nonetheless, by all accounts it appears that the Web will ultimately devolve into
a mass medium for entertainment and for e-commerce, just like traditional television.

Meaningful personal interactivity is already yielding to advertising, requests for product
information, buy-seU orders, and titillating adult-oriented content.

Thus, on balance these high-speed electronic media do indeed tend to prevent rather than
facilitate meaningful and thoughtful communication. In the final analysis, any mass medium
carries the potential for uplifting us, enlightening us, and helping us to communicate with and
understand one another. However, by all accounts, television has not fulfilled that potential;
and whether the Web will serve us any better is ultimately up to us as a society.
