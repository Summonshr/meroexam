Most important discoveries or creations are accidental: it is usually while seeking the answer
to one question that we come across the answer to another.

The speaker contends that most important discoveries and creations are accident~-----that
they come about when we are seeking answers to other questions. I concede that this
contention finds considerable support from important discoveries of the past. However, the
contention overstates the role of accident, or serendipity, when it comes to modern day
discoveries--and when it comes to creations.

Turning first to discoveries, I agree that discovery often occurs when we unexpectedly
happen upon something in our quest for something else--such as an answer to unrelated
question or a solution to an unrelated problem. A variety of geographical, scientific, and
anthropological discoveries aptly illustrate this point. In search of a trade route to the West
Indies Columbus discovered instead an inhabited continent unknown to Europeans; and
during the course of an unrelated experiment Fleming accidentally discovered penicillin. In
search of answers to questions about marine organisms, oceanographers often happen upon
previously undiscovered, and important, archeological artifacts and geological phenomena;
conversely, in their quest to understand the Earth's structure and history geologists often
stumble upon important human artifacts. In light of the foregoing examples, **intentional
discovery** might seem an oxymoron; yet in fact it is not. Many important discoveries are
anticipated and sought out purposefully.

For instance, in their efforts to find new celestial bodies astronomers using increasingly
powerful telescopes do indeed find them. Biochemists often discover important new vaccines
and other biological and chemical agents for the curing, preventing, and treating diseases not
by stumbling upon them in search of something else but rather through methodical search for
these discoveries. In fact, in today's world discovery is becoming increasingly an anticipated
result of careful planning and methodical research, for the reason that scientific advancement
now requires significant resources that only large corporations and governments possess.

These entities are accountable to their share-holders and constituents, who demand dear
strategies and objectives so that they can see a return on their investments.

Turning next to how our creations typically come about, in marked contrast to discoveries,
creations are by nature products of their creators' purposeful designs. Consider humankind's
key creations, such as the printing press, the internal combustion engine, and semi-conductor
technology. Each of these inventions sprung quite intentionally from the inventor's imagination
and objectives. It is crucial to distinguish here between a creation and the spin-offs from that
creation, which the original creator may or may not foresee. For instance, the engineers at a
handful of universities who originally created the ARPAnet as a means to transfer data
amongst themselves certainly intended to create that network for that purpose. What these
engineers did not intend to create, however, was what would eventually grow to become the
infrastrucRLre for mass media and communications, and even commerce. Yet the ARPAnet
itself was no accident, nor are the many creations that it spawned, such as the World Wide
Web and the coundess creations that the Web has in turned spawned.

In sum, the speaker has overlooked a crucial distinction between the nature of discovery
and the nature of creation. Although serendipity has always played a key role in many
important discoveries, at least up until now, purposeful intent is necessarily the key to human
creation.
