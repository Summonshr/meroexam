**If a goal is worthy, then any means taken to attain it is justifiable.**

The speaker asserts that if a goal is worthy then any means of attaining that goal is
justifiable. In my view this extreme position misses the point entirely. Whether certain means
are justifiable in reaching a goal must be determined on a case-by-case basis, by weighing the
benefits of attaining the goal against the costs, or harm, that might accrue along the way. This
applies equally to individual goals and to societal goals.

Consider the goal of completing a marathon running race. If I need to reduce my working
hours to train for the race, thereby jeopardizing my job, or if I run a high risk of incurring a
permanent injury by training enough to prepare adequately for the event, then perhaps my
goal is not worth attaining. Yet if I am a physically challenged person with the goal of
completing a highly-publicized marathon, risking financial hardship or long-term injury might be
worthwhile, not only for my own personal satisfaction but also for the inspiration that attaining
the goal would provide many others.

Or consider the goal of providing basic food and shelter for an innocent child. Anyone would
agree that this goal is highly worthy--considered apart from the means used to achieve it. But
what if those means involve stealing from others? Or what if they involve employing the child in
a sweatshop at the expense of educating the child? Clearly, determining the worthiness of
such goals requires that we confront moral dilemmas, which we each solve individually--based
on our own conscience, value system, and notions of fairness and equity.

On a societal level we determine the worthiness of our goals in much the same way--by
weighing competing interests. For instance, any thoughtful person would agree that reducing
air and water pollution is a worthy societal goal; dean air and water reduce the burden on our
health-care resources and improves the quality of life for everyone in society. Yet to attain this
goal would we be justified in forcing entire industries out of business, thereby running the risk
of economic paralysis and widespread unemployment?
Or consider America's intervention in Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did our dual interest in a
continuing flow of oil to the West and in deterring a potential threat against the security of the
world justify our committing resources that could have been used instead for domestic
social-welfare programs--or a myriad of other productive purposes? Both issues underscore
the fact that the worthiness of a societal goal cannot be considered apart from the means and
adverse consequences of attaining that goal.

In sum, the speaker begs the question. The worthiness of any goal, whether it be personal
or societal, can be determined only by weighing the benefits of achieving the goal against its
costs--to us as well as others.
