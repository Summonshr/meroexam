A person's own habits and attitudes often limit that person's freedom more than do restrictions
imposed by others.

I strongly agree with the contention that we often limit our own freedom through our habits
and attitudes. By limiting our own freedom, we often serve our own interests. And as we learn
this lesson, we cultivate certain attitudes and habits--particularly in our relationships with
others--by which we apply that lesson, and which continue throughout life.

To appreciate that from an early age we ingrain in ourselves habits that serve to constrain
our freedom, one need look no further than the neighborhood playground. Even without adult
supervision, a group of youngsters at play invariably establish mutually agreed-upon rules of
conduct--whether or not a sport or game is involved. Children learn that without any rules for
behavior the playground bully usually prevails. Thus our habit of making choices that constrain
our own freedom stems from our desire to protect our own interests, and it begins at an early
age.

This habit of making choices that constrain our own freedom continues into our adult lives.

As we mature, most of us develop the attitude that monogamous relationships are preferable
to polygamous ones--thus our habit of entering into exclusive pair-bonding relationships.

During our teens we agree to **go steady,** then as adults we voluntarily enter into marriage
contracts. As we enter the working world, we carry these attitudes and habits with us. We
eagerly engage in exclusive employment relationships---with the attitude that the security of
steady income is preferable to the **freedom** of not knowing where our next paycheck will
come from. Even people who prefer self-employment to job security quickly develop the
attitude that the only way to preserve their autonomy is to constrain themselves in terms of
their agreements with clients and customers, and especially in terms of how they use their me.

Those who disagree that we tend to restrict our own freedom through our habits and
attitudes involving personal and employment relationships might cite the often-heard complaint
about life's circumstances leaving one with **no choice.** One complaining person might feel
trapped in a job or a marriage, by their boss or partner. Another complainant might blame his
or her spendthrift habits on enticing advertisements, the pressure to appear successful, and so
forth. However, people in situations such as these are not actually at the mercy of others.

Instead, they have a significant degree of personal freedom, but simply choose one alternative
over others that might be less appealing or even self-defeating. For example, almost every
person who blames someone else for being trapped in a job is simply choosing to retain a
certain measure of financial security. The choice to forego this security is always available,
although it might carry unpleasant consequences.

That through our attitudes we serve to constrain our own freedom is evident on a societal
level as well. Just as children at a playground quickly develop the habit of imposing rules and
regulations on themselves, as a society we do the same. After all, in a democracy our system
of laws is an invention of the people. For example, we insist on being bound by restrictions for
operadng motor vehides, for buying and selling both real and personal property, and for
making public statements about other people. Without these restrictions, we would live in
continual fear for our physical safety, the security of our property, and our personal reputation
and dignity. Thus most of the rules and regulations we claim are imposed on us we have
ultimately imposed on ourselves, as a society, in order to protect ourselves.

In the final analysis, in contenting that our habits and attitudes **often** serve to restrict our
freedom more than restraints that others place on us do, the statement does not even go far
enough. Despite our occasional sense that others are restricting our choices, on both an
individual and a societal level we are ultimately the ones who, through our attitudes and habits,
limit our own freedom.
