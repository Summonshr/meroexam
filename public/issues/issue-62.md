Tradition and modernization are incompatible. One must choose between them.

Must we choose between tradition and modernization, as the speaker contends.; I agree
that in certain cases the two are mutually exclusive. For the most part, however, modernization
does not reject tradition; in fact, in many cases the former can and does embrace the latter.

In the first place, oftentimes so-caUed **modernization** is actually an extension or new
iteration of tradition, or a variation on it. This is especially true in language and in law. The
modern English language, in spite of its many words that are unique to modern Western
culture, is derived from, and builds upon, a variety of linguistic traditions--and ultimately from
the ancient Greek and Latin languages. Were we to insist on rejecting traditional in favor of
purely modern language, we would have essentially nothing to say. Perhaps an even more
striking marriage of modernization and tradition is our system of laws in the U.S., which is
deeply rooted in English common-law principles of equity and justice. Our system requires that
new, so-called **modern** laws be consistent with, and in fact build upon, those principles.

In other areas modernization departs from tradition in some respects, while embracing it in
others. In the visual arts, for example, **modern** designs, forms, and elements are based on
certain timeless aesthetic ideals--such as symmetry, balance, and harmony. Modern art that
violates these principles might hold ephemeral appeal due to its novelty and brashness, but its
appeal lacks staying power. An even better example from the arts is modern rock-and-roll
music, which upon first listening might seem to bear no resemblance to classical music
traditions. Yet, both genres rely on the same twelve-note scale, the same notions of what
harmonies are pleasing to the ear, the same forms, the same rhythmic meters, and even many
of the same melodies.

I concede that, in certain instances, tradition must yield entirely to the utilitarian needs of
modern life. This is true especially when it comes to architectural traditions and the value of
historic and archeological artifacts. A building of great historic value might be located in the
only place available to a hospital desperately needing additional parking area. An old school
that is a prime example of a certain architectural style might be so structurally unsafe that the
only practicable way to remedy the problem would be to raze the building to make way for a
modern, structurally sound one. And when it comes to bridges whose structural integrity is
paramount to public safety, modernization often requires no less than replacement of the
bridge altogether. However, in other such cases architecturally appropriate retrofits can solve
structural problems without sacrificing history and tradition, and alternative locations for new
buildings and bridges can be found in order to preserve tradition associated with our historic
structures. Thus, even in architecture, tradition and modernization are not necessarily mutually
exclusive options.

To sum up, in no area of human endeavor need modernization supplant, reject, or otherwise
exclude tradition. In fact, in our modern structures, architecture and other art, and especially
languages and law, tradition is embraced, not shunned.
