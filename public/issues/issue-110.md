**Too much time, money, and energy are spent developing new and more elaborate technology.
Society should instead focus on maximizing the use of existing technology for the immediate
benefit of its citizens.**

The speaker asserts that rather than devoting its resources to developing new technology,
society should try to maximize the use of technology already available. While I would concede
that in a few areas society might be well served by adopting this recommendation, in general I
disagree with the speaker.

Admittedly, when a society's members devote their collective time, energy, talent, and money
to developing a new and more elaborate technology, the society necessarily incurs various
opportunity costs. The space program aptly illustrates this point. Virtually every additional step
in space exploration requires new technology, which diverts our resources from addressing
pressing problems here on Earth. Of course, space technologies have imparted a myriad of
benefits in areas such as weather forecasting, telecommunications, chemical engineering, and
medical technology, to name just a few. Yet, these technologies were developed in Earth's
orbit and for the most part were stated objectives of our space missions. Our goals in probing
further into space are far more vague: to learn more about the universe, its origins and destiny,
and to search for life elsewhere. Thus society might be better served by redirecting resources
used for developing new space exploration technology toward programs which impart clear,
certain, and immediate societal benefits and which avail themselves to a greater extent of
current technologies.

Yet space exploration is an exceptional and extreme example. In other areas the benefits of
new technology are far more immediate and certain, and thus justify the new technology.

Consider, for example, computer semi-conductor technology. The benefits of continually
developing faster, more reliable, and more affordable processors are immediate, predictable,
and profound. To halt advances in semi-conductor technology at any given point would be to
impede progress in global communication, knowledge and information access, the
development of safer buildings and vehides, and even the cure and prevention of disease.

The call for new computing technology seems particularly compelling in light of the last area
listed above. A great measure of valuable genetic research would simply not be possible
without the aid of fast and reliable computers. And effective treatment and cure of many
diseases also require more precise lasers and more powerful microscopes than those
currently available. In short, maximizing the use of existing technology in lieu of developing
new technology will not suffice to cure, prevent, and treat many diseases. Thus the speaker
would have society resign itself to its current state of physical health and well being--a dismal
prospect for society and for all humanity.

In sum, I find the speaker's recommendation indefensible. Admittedly, as a society we
should be careful not to pursue new technology merely for technology's sake or to satisfy our
curiosity. It is important that we direct our resources in ways that clearly benefit the society.

Nonetheless, without new technology we resign ourselves to life less safe, less healthy, and
less interesting than it need be.
