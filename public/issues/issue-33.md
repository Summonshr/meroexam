Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's
field of study because acquiring knowledge of various academic disciplines is the best way to
become truly educated.

I fundamentally agree with the proposition that students must take courses outside their
major field of study to become **truly educated.** A contrary position would reflect a too narrow
view of higher education and its proper objectives. Nevertheless, I would caution that
extending the proposition too far might risk undermining those objectives.

The primary reason why I agree with the proposition is that **me** education amounts to far
more than gaining the knowledge and ability to excel in one's major course of study and in
one's professional career. True education also facilitates an understanding of one- self, and
tolerance and respect for the viewpoints of others. Courses in psychology, sociology, and
anthropology all serve these ends. **True** education also provides insight and perspective
regarding one's place in society and in the physical and metaphysical worlds. Courses in
political science, philosophy, theology, and even sciences such as astronomy and physics can
help a student gain this insight and perspective. Finally, no student can be truly educated
without having gained an aesthetic appreciation of the world around us--through course work
in literature, the fine arts, and the performing arts.

Becoming truly educated also requires sufficient mastery of one academic area to permit a
student to contribute meaningfully to society later in life. Yet, mastery of any specific area
requires some knowledge about a variety of others. For example, a political-science student
can fully understand that field only by understanding the various psychological, sociological,
and historical forces that shape political ideology. An anthropologist cannot excel without
understanding the social and political events that shape cultures, and without some knowledge
of chemistry and geology for performing field work. Even computer engineering is intrinsically
tied to other fields, even non-technical ones such as business, communications, and media.

Nevertheless, the call for a broad educational experience as the path to becoming truly
educated comes with one important caveat. A student who merely dabbles in a hodgepodge of
academic offerings, without special emphasis on any one, becomes a dilettante lacking
enough knowledge or experience in any single area to come away with anything valuable to
offer. Thus in the pursuit of true education students must be careful not to overextend
themselves----or risk defeating an important objective of education.

In the final analysis, to become truly educated one must strike a proper balance in one's
educational pursuits. Certainly, students should strive to excel in the specific requirements of
their major course of study. However, they should complement those efforts by pursuing
course work in a variety of other areas as well. By earnestly pursuing a broad education one
gains the capacity not only to succeed in a career, but also to find purpose and meaning in that
career as well as to understand and appreciate the world and its peoples. To gain these
capacities is to become **truly educated.
