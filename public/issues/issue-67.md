Students should bring a certain skepticism to whatever they study. They should question what
they are taught instead of accepting it passively.

The speaker contends that students should be skeptical in their studies, and should not
accept passively whatever they are taught. In my view, although undue skepticism might be
counterproductive for a young child's education, I strongly agree with the speaker otherwise.

Ifwe were all to accept on blind faith all that we are taught, our society would never progress or
evolve.

Skepticism is perhaps most important in the physical sciences. Passive acceptance of
prevailing principles quells innovation, invention, and discovery. In fact, the very notion of
scientific progress is predicated on rigorous scientific inquiry--in other words, skepticism. And
history is replete with examples of students of science who challenged what they had been
taught, thereby paving the way for scientific progress. For example, in challenging the notion
that the Earth was in a fixed position at the center of the universe, Copernicus paved the way
for the corroborating observations of Galileo a century later, and ultimately for Newton's
principles of gravity upon which all modern science is based. The staggering cumulative
impact of Copernicus' rejection of what he had been taught is proof enough of the value of
skepticism.

The value of skepticism is not limited to the physical sciences, of course. In the fields of
sociology and political science, students must think critically about the assumptions underlying
the status quo; otherwise, oppression, tyranny and prejudice go unchecked. Similarly, while
students of the law must learn to appreciate timeless legal doctrines and principles, they must
continually question the fairness and relevance of current laws. Otherwise, our laws would not
evolve to reflect changing societal values and to address new legal issues arising from our
ever-evolving technologies.

Even in the arts, students must challenge established styles and forms rather than learn to
imitate them; otherwise, no genuinely new art would ever emerge. Bee-bop musicians such as
Charlie Parker demonstrated through their wildly innovative harmonies and melodies their
skepticism about established rules for harmony and melody. In the area of dance BaUanchine
showed by way of his improvisational techniques his skepticism about established rules for
choreography. And Germany's Bauhaus School of Architecture, to which modern architecture
owes its existence, was rooted in skepticism about the proper objective, and resulting design,
of public buildings.

Admittedly, undue skepticism might be counterproductive in educating young children. I am
not an expert in developmental psychology; yet observation and common sense informs me
that youngsters must first develop a foundation of experiential knowledge before they can
begin to think critically about what they are learning. Even so, in my view no student, no matter
how young, should be discouraged from asking **Why?** and **Why not?**
To sum up, skepticism is the very stuff that progress is made of, whether it be in science,
sociology, politics, the law, or the arts. Therefore, skepticism should be encouraged at all but
the most basic levels of education.
