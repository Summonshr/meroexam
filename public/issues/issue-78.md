Those who treat politics and morality as though they were separate realms fail to understand
either the one or the other.

Should politics and morality be treated as though they are mutually exclusive? I strongly
agree with the speaker that any person claiming so fails to understand either the one or the
other. An overly narrow definition of morality might require complete forthrightness and
candidness in dealings with others. However, the morality of public politics embraces far
broader concerns involving the welfare of society, and recognizes compromise as a necessary,
and legitimate, means of addressing those concerns.

It is wrong-headed to equate moral behavior in politics with the simple notions of honesty
and putting the other fellow's needs ahead of one's own----or other ways which we typically
measure the morality of an individual's private behavior. Public politics is a game played
among professional politicians--and to succeed in the game one must use the tools that are
part-and-parcel of it. Complete forthrightness is a sign of vulnerability and naivet~, neither of
which will earn a politician respect among his or her opponents, and which opponents will use
to every advantage against the honest politician. Moreover, the rhetoric of a successful
politician eschews rigorous factually inquiry and indisputable fact while appealing to emotions,
ideals, and subjective interpretation and characterizations. For example, the politician who
claims his opponent is **anti-business,** **bad for the economy,** or **out of touch with what voters
want** is not necessarily behaving immorally. We must understand that this sort of rhetoric is
part-and-parcel of public politics, and thus kept in perspective does not harm the society--as
long as it does not escalate to outright lying.

Those who disagree with the statement also fail to understand that in order to gain the
opportunity for moral leadership politicians must engage in certain compromises along the way.

Politics is a business born not only of idealism but also of pragmatism insofar as in order to be
effective a politician must gain and hold onto political power. In my observation, some degree
of pandering to the electorate and to those who might lend financial support for reelection
efforts is necessary to maintain that position. Modern politics is replete with candidates who
refused to pander, thereby mining their own chance to exercise effective leadership.

Finally, those who claim that effective politicians need not concern themselves with morality
fail to appreciate that successful political leadership, ifit is to endure, ultimately requires a
certain measure of public morality--that is, serving the society with its best interests as the
leader's overriding concern. Consider the many leaders, such as Stalin and Hitler, whom most
people would agree were egregious violators of public morality. Ultmately such leaders forfeit
their leadership as a result of the immoral means by which they obtain or wield their power. Or
consider less egregious examples such as President Nixon, whose contempt for the very legal
system that afforded him his leadership led to his forfeiture of that leadership. It seems to me
that in the short term amoral or immoral public behavior might serve a political leader's interest
in preserving power; yet in the long term such behavior invariably results in that leader's
downfall.

In sum, I fundamentally agree with the statement. It recognizes that the **game** of politics
calls for a certain amount of disingenuousness that we might associate with dubious private
morality. And it recognizes that such behavior is a necessary means to the final objective of
moral political leadership. Besides, at the end of the political game any politician failing to
exercise moral leadership ultimately forfeits the game.
