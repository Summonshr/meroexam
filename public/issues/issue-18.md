Money spent on research is almost always a good investment, even when the results of that
research are controversial.


I agree with the speaker's broad assertion that money spent on research is generally money
well invested. However, the speaker unnecessarily extends this broad assertion to embrace
research whose results are **controversial,** while ignoring certain compelling reasons why
some types of research might be unjustifiable. My points of contention with the speaker
involves the fundamental objectives and nature of research, as discussed below.

I concede that the speaker is on the correct philosophical side of this issue. After all,
research is the exploration of the unknown for true answers to our questions, and for lasting
solutions to our enduring problems. Research is also the chief means by which we humans
attempt to satisfy our insatiable appetite for knowledge, and our craving to understand
ourselves and the world around us. Yet, in the very notion of research also lies my first point of
contention with the speaker, who illogically presumes that we can know the results of research
before we invest in it. To the contrary, if research is to be of any value it must explore
uncharted and unpredictable territory. In fact, query whether research whose benefits are
immediate and predictable can break any new ground, or whether it can be considered
**research** at all.

While we must invest in research irrespective of whether the results might be controversial,
at the same time we should be circumspect about research whose objectives are too vague
and whose potential benefits are too speculative. After all, expensive research always carries
significant opportunity costs--in terms of how the money might be spent toward addressing
society's more immediate problems that do not require research. One apt illustration of this
point involves the so-called **Star Wars** defense initiative, championed by the Reagan
administration during the 1980s. In retrospect, this initiative was ill-conceived and largely a
waste of taxpayer dollars; and few would dispute that the exorbitant amount of money devoted
to the initiative could have gone a long way toward addressing pressing social problems of the
day--by establishing after-school programs for delinquent latchkey kids, by enhancing AIDS
awareness and education, and so forth. As it turns out, at the end of the Star Wars debacle we
were left with rampant gang violence, an AIDS epidemic, and an unprecedented federal
budget deficit.

The speaker's assertion is troubling in two other r~sp,ects as well. First, no amount of
research can completely solve the enduring pr~l~rm of war, poverty, and violence, for the
reason that they stem from certain aspects of human nature--such as aggression and greed.

Although human genome research might eventually enable us to engineer away those
undesirable aspects of our nature, in the meantime it is up to our economists, diplomats, social
reformers, and jurists--not our research laboratories--to mitigate these problems. Secondly, for
every new research breakthrough that helps reduce human suffering is another that serves
primarily to add to that suffering. For example, while some might argue that physics
researchers who harnessed the power of the atom have provided us with an alternative source
of energy and invaluable **peace-keepers,** this argument flies in the face of the hundreds of
thousands of innocent people murdered and maimed by atomic blasts, and by nuclear
meltdowns. And, in fulfilling the promise of **better living through chemistry** research has given
us chemical weapons for human slaughter. In short, so-called **advances** that scientific
research has brought about often amount to net losses for humanity.

In sum, the speaker's assertion that we should invest in research whose results are
**controversial** begs the question, because we cannot know whether research will turn out
controversial until we've invested in it. As for the speaker's broader assertion, I agree that
money spent on research is generally a sound investment because it is an investment in the
advancement of human knowledge and in human imagination and spirit. Nevertheless, when
we do research purely for its own sake without aim or clear purpose--we risk squandering
resources which could have been applied to relieve the immediate suffering of our dispirited,
disadvantaged, and disenfranchised members of society. In the final analysis, given finite
economic resources we are forced to strike a balance in how we allocate those resources
among competing societal objectives.
