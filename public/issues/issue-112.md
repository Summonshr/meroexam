In order for any work of art---whether film, literature, sculpture, or a song---to have merit, it
must be understandable to most people.

The speaker's assertion that art must be widely understood to have merit is wrongheaded.

The speaker misunderstands the final objective of art, which has little to do with cognitive
**understanding**.

First consider the musical art form. The fact that the listener must **understand** the
composer's artistic expression without the benefit of words or visual images forces us to ask:
**What is there to understand in the first place?** Of course, the listener can always struggle to
appreciate how the musical piece employs various harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic principles.

Yet it would be absurd to assert that the objective of music is to challenge the listener's
knowledge of music theory. In fact, listening to music is simply an encounter--an experience to
be accepted at face value for its aural impact on our spirit and our emotions.

Next consider the art forms of painting and sculpture. In the context of these art forms, the
speaker seems to suggest that ifwe cannot all understand what the work is supposed to
represent, then we should dismiss the work as worthless. Again, however, the speaker misses
the point of art. Only by provoking and challenging us, and inciting our emotions, imagination,
and wonder do paintings and sculpture hold merit. Put another way, if the test for meritorious
art were its ability to be dearly understood by every observer, then our most valuable art would
simply imitate the mundane physical world around us. A Polaroid picture taken by a monkey
would be considered great art, while the abstract works of Pollock and Picasso would be worth
no more than the salvage value of the materials used to create them.

Finally, consider art forms such as poetry, song, and prose, where the use of language is
part-and-parcel of the art. It is easy to assume that where words are involved they must be
strung together in understandable phrases in order for the art to have any merit. Moreover, if
the writer-artist resorts exclusively to obscure words that people simply do not know, then the
art can convey nothing beyond the alliterative or onomatopoeic impact that the words might
have when uttered aloud. However, in poetry and song the writer-artist often uses words as
imagery--to conjure up feelings and evoke visceral reactions in the reader or listener. In these
cases stanzas and verses need not be **understood** to have merit, as much as they need be
experienced for the images and emotions they evoke.

When it comes to prose, admittedly the writer-artist must use words to convey cognitive
ideas--for example, to help the reader follow the plot of a novel. In these cases the art must
truly be **understood** on a Linguistic and cognitive level; otherwise it is mere gibberish
without merit except perhaps as a doorstop. Nevertheless, the final objective even of literature
is to move the reader emotionally and spiritually--not simply to inform. Thus, even though a
reader might understand the twists and turns of a novel's plot intellectually, what's the point if
the reader has come away unaffected in emotion or spirit?
In the final analysis, whether art must be understood by most people, or by any person, in
order for it to have merit begs the question. To **understand** art a person need only have eyes
to see or ears to hear, and a soul to feel.
