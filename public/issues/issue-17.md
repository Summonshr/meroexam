**The primary goal of technological advancement should be to increase people's efficiency so
that everyone has more leisure time.**


The speaker contends that technology's primary goal should be to increase our efficiency for
the purpose of affording us more leisure time. I concede that technology has enhanced our
efficiency as we go about our everyday lives. Productivity software helps us plan and
coordinate projects; intranets, the Internet, and satellite technology make us more efficient
messengers; and technology even helps us prepare our food and access entertainment more
efficiently. Beyond this concession, however, I find the speaker's contention indefensible from
both an empirical and a normative standpoint.

The chief reason for my disagreement lies in the empirical proof: with technological
advancement comes diminished leisure time. In 1960 the average U.S. family included only
one breadwinner, who worked just over 40 hours per week. Since then the average work week
has increased steadily to nearly 60 hours today; and in most families there are now two
breadwinners. What explains this decline in leisure despite increasing efficiency that new
technologies have brought about? I contend that technology itself is the culprit behind the
decline. We use the additional free time that technology affords us not for leisure but rather for
work. As computer technology enables greater and greater office productivity it also raises our
employers' expectations--or demands--for production. Further technological advances breed
still greater efficiency and, in turn, expectations. Our spiraling work load is only exacerbated by
the competitive business environment in which nearly all of us work today. Moreover, every
technological advance demands our time and attention in order to learn how to use the new
technology. Time devoted to keeping pace with technology depletes time for leisure activities.

I disagree with the speaker for another reason as well: the suggestion that technology's
chief goal should be to facilitate leisure is simply wrongheaded. There are far more vital
concerns that technology can and should address. Advances in bio-technology can help cure
and prevent diseases; advances in medical technology can allow for safer, less invasire
diagnosis and treatment; advances in genetics can help prevent birth defects; advances in
engineering and chemistry can improve the structural integrity of our buildings, roads, bridges
and vehicles; information technology enables education while communication technology
facilitates global participation in the democratic process. In short, health, safety, education, and
freedom--and not leisure--are the proper final objectives of technology. Admittedly, advances
in these areas sometimes involve improved efficiency; yet efficiency is merely a means to
these more important ends.

In sum, I find indefensible the speaker's suggestion that technology's value lies chiefly in the
efficiency and resulting leisure time it can afford us. The suggestion runs contrary to the
overwhelming evidence that technology diminishes leisure time, and it wrongly places leisure
ahead of goals such as health, safety, education, and freedom as technology's ultimate aims.
