**When research priorities are being set for science, education, or any other area, the most
important question to consider is: How many people's lives will be improved if the results are
successful?**


Should researchers focus on areas that are likely to result in the greatest benefit to the most
people, as the speaker suggests? I agree insofar as areas of research certain to result in
immediate and significant benefits for society should continue to be a priority. Yet, strictly
followed, the speaker's recommendation would have a harmful chilling effect on research and
new knowledge. This is particularly true in the physical sciences, as discussed below.

Admittedly, scientific research whose societal benefits are immediate, predictable, and
profound should continue to be a high priority. For example, biotechnology research is proven
to help cure and prevent diseases; advances in medical technology allow for safer, less
invasive diagnosis and treatment; advances in genetics help prevent birth defects; advances in
engineering and chemistry improve the structural integrity of our buildings, roads, bridges, and
vehicles; information technology enables education; and communication technology facilitates
global peace and participation in the democratic process. To demote any of these research
areas to a lower priority would be patently foolhardy, considering their proven benefits to so
many people. However, this is not to say that research whose benefits are less immediate or
clear should be given lower priority. For three reasons, all avenues of scientific research
should be afforded equal priority.

First of all, ifwe strictly follow the speaker's suggestion, who would decide which areas of
research are more worthwhile than others? Researchers cannot be left to decide. Given a
choice, they will pursue their own special areas of interest, and it is highly unlikely that all
researchers could reach a fully informed consensus as to what areas are most likely to help
the most people. Nor can these decisions be left to regulators and legislators, who would bring
to bear their own quirky notions about what is worthwhile, and whose susceptibility to
influence-peddlers renders them untrustworthy in any event.

A telling example of the inherent danger of setting **official** research priorities involves the
Soviet government's attempts during the 1920s to not only control the direction and the goals
of its scientists' research but also to distort the outcome of that research--ostensibly for the
greatest good of the greatest number of people. During the 1920s the Soviet government
quashed certain areas of scientific inquiry, destroyed entire research facilities and libraries,
and caused the sudden disappearance of many scientists who were viewed as threats the
state's authority. Not surprisingly, during this time period no significant scientific advances
occurred under the auspices of the Soviet government.

Secondly, to compel all researchers to focus only on certain areas would be to force many to
waste their true talents. For example, imagine relegating today's preeminent astrophysicist
Stephen Hawking to research the effectiveness of behavioral modification techniques in the
reform of violent criminals. Admittedly, this example borders on hyperbole. Yet the aggregate
effect of realistic cases would be to waste the intellectual talents of our world's researchers.

Moreover, lacking genuine interest or motivation a researcher would be unlikely to contribute
meaningfully to his or her **assigned** field.

Thirdly, it is difficult to predict which research avenues will ultimately lead to the greatest
contributions to society. Research areas whose benefits are certain often break little new
ground, and in the long term so-called **cutting-edge** research whose potential benefits are
unknown often prove most useful to society. One current example involves
terraforrning---creating biological life and a habitable atmosphere where none existed before.

This unusual research area does not immediately address society's pressing social problems.

Yet in the longer term it might be necessary to colonize other planets in order to ensure the
survival of the human race; and after all, what could be a more significant contribution to
society than preventing its extinction?
In sum, when it comes to setting priorities for research, at least in the sciences, the speaker
goes too far by implying that research whose benefits are unknown are not worth pursuing.

After all, any research worth doing delves into the unknown. In the final analysis, the only
objective of research should be to discover truths, whatever they might be-- not to implement
social policy.
