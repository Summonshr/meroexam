**It is easy to welcome innovation and accept new ideas. What most people find difficult,
however, is accepting the way these new ideas are put into practice.**


The speaker maintains that it is easy to accept innovation and new ideas, yet difficult to
accept how they are put to use. In my view the speaker has it backwards when it comes to
socio-political ideas, at least in our democratic society. Nevertheless, I tend to agree with the
speaker insofar as scientific innovation is concerned.

In the areas of politics and law, new ideas are not often easily accepted. More often than not,
the status quo affords people a measure of security and predictability in terms of what they can
expect from their government and what rights and duties they have under the law. The
civil-fights movement of the 1960s aptly illustrates this point. The personal freedoms and rights
championed by leading civil-rights leaders of that era threatened the status quo, which
tolerated discrimination based on race and gender, thereby sanctioning prejudice of all kinds.

The resulting civil unrest, especially the protests and riots that characterized the late 1960s,
was dear evidence that new ideas were not welcome. And today those who advocate gay and
lesbian rights are encountering substantial resistance as well, this time primarily from certain
religious quarters.

Yet once society grows to accept these new ideas, it seems that it has an easier time
accepting how they are put into practice. The explanation for this lies in the fact that our
system of laws is based on legal precedent. New ideas must past muster among the
government's legislative, judicial, and executive branches, and ultimately the voters, before
these ideas can be codified, implemented and enforced. Once they've passed the test of our
democratic and legal systems, they are more readily welcomed by the citizenry at large.

In contrast, consider innovations in the natural sciences. It seems that we universally
embrace any new technology in the name of progress. Of course there are always in formed
dissenters with legitimate concerns. For example, many scientists strongly opposed the
Manhattan Project, by which nuclear warfare was made possible. Innovations involving
alternative energy sources meet with resistance from those who rely on and profit from fossil
fuels. Some sociologists and psychologists claim that advances in Internet technology WIU
alienate society's members from one another. And opponents of genetic engineering predict
certain deleterious social and political consequences.

Yet the reasons why these dissenters oppose certain innovations have to do with their
potential applications and uses, not with the renovations themselves. Edward Teller, the father
of the atom bomb, foresaw the benefits of atomic energy, yet understood the grave
consequences of applying the technology instead for destruction. Innovations involving
alternative energy sources meet with resistance from many businesses because of their
potential application in ways that will threaten the financial interests of these businesses. And
those who would impede advances in Internet technology fear that consumers and businesses
will use the technology for crass commercialism, exploitation, and white-collar crime, rather
than for the sorts of educational and communication purposes for which it was originally
designed. Finally, opponents of genetic engineering fear that, rather than using it to cure birth
defects and prevent disease, the technology will be used instead by the wealthy elite to breed
superior offspring, thereby causing society's socioeconomic gap to widen even further, even
resulting in the creation of a master race.

In sum, when it comes to new social and political ideas, the power and security afforded by
the status quo impedes initial acceptance, yet by the same token ensures that the ideas will be
applied in ways that will be welcome by our society. On the other hand, it seems that scientific
innovation is readily embraced yet meets stronger resistance when it comes to applying the
innovation.
