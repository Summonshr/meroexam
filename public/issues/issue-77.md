**Critical judgment of work in any given field has little value unless it comes from someone who
is an expert in that field.**

The speaker's assertion that work in any field can be judged only by experts in that field
amounts to an unfair generalization, in my view. I would concur with the speaker when it
comes to judging the work of social scientists, although I would strongly disagree when it
comes to work in the pure physical sciences, as explained in the following discussion.

With respect to the social sciences, the social world presents a seamless web of not only
anthropogenic but also physical forces, which interact in ways that can be understood only in
the context of a variety of disciplines. Thus experts from various fields must collectively
determine the merit of work in the social sciences. For example, consider the field of cultural
anthropology. The merits of researcher's findings and conclusions about an ancient civilization
must be scrutinized by biochemists, geologists, linguists, and even astronomers.

Specifically, by analyzing the hair, nails, blood and bones of mummified bodies, biochemists
and forensic scientists can pass judgment on the anthropologist's conjectures about the life
expectancy, general well-being, and common causes of death of the population. Geologists
are needed to identify the source and age of the materials used for tools, weapons, and
structures--thereby determining whether the anthropologist extrapolated correctly about the
civilization's economy, trades and work habits, life styles, extent of travel and mobility, and so
forth. Linguists are needed to interpret hieroglyphics and extrapolate from found fragments of
writings. And astronomers are sometimes needed to determine with the anthropologist's
explanations for the layout of an ancient city or the design, structure and position of
monuments, tombs, and temples is convincing-because ancients often looked to the stars for
guidance in building cities and structures.

In contrast, the work of researchers in the purely physical sciences can be judged only by
their peers. The reason for this is that scientific theories and observations are either
meritorious or not, depending solely on whether they can be proved or disproved by way of the
scientific method. For example, consider the complex equations which physicists rely upon to
draw conclusions about the nature of matter, time, and space, or the origins and future of the
universe. Only other physicists in these specialties can understand, let alone judge, this type of
theoretical work. Similarly, empirical observations in astrophysics and molecular physics
require extremely sophisticated equipment and processes, which only experts in these fields
have access to and who know how to use reliably.

Those who disagree that only inside experts can judge scientific work might point out that
the expertise of economists and pubic-policy makers is required to determine whether the
work is worthwhile from a more mundane economic or political viewpoint. Detractors might
also point out that ultimately it is our philosophers who are best equipped to judge the ultimate
import of ostensibly profound scientific discoveries. Yet these detractors miss the point of what
I take to be the speaker's more narrow claim: that the integrity and quality of
work---disregarding its socioeconomic utility----can be judged only by experts in the work's
field.

In sum, in the social sciences no area of inquiry operates in a vacuum. Because fields such
as anthropology, sociology, and history are so closely intertwined and even dependent on the
physical sciences, experts from various fields must collectively determine the integrity and
quality of work in these fields. However, in the purely physical sciences the quality and integrity
of work can be adequately judged only by inside experts, who are the only ones equipped with
sufficient technical knowledge to pass judgment.
