**The way people look, dress, and act reveals their attitudes and interests. You can tell much
about a society's ideas and values by observing the appearance and behavior of its people.**

This statement generalizes unfairly that the way people look, dress, and act reveals their
attitudes and their society's values. In my view, while in certain respects the habits and
customs of a people are accurate indicators of their attitudes and values, in other respects
they are not.

Turning first to the way people look and dress, certain aspects of the outward appearance of
a culture's people do inform us of their ideas, attitudes, and values. A society whose members
tend to be obese might place a high value on indulgence and pleasure, and a low value on
physical health. A general preference for ready-made, inexpensive clothing might indicate a
preference for practicality or for saving rather than spending. And, a society whose members
prefer to wear clothing that is traditional and distinct to that society is one that values tradition
over modernization. In other respects, however, the way people look and dress is not a
function of their attitudes and values but rather their climatic and work environment. In harsh
climates people bundle up, while in hot, humid climates they go with few clothes. In developed
nations people dress for indoor work and their skin appears pink and supple, while in agrarian
cultures people dress for outdoor work and appear weather-beaten.

I turn next to the way people act. The habits, rituals and lifestyles of a culture often do
provide accurate signals about its values. For instance, a society characterized by
over-consumption is clearly one that values comfort and convenience over a healthy
environment. And, a society whose members behave in a genteel, respectful, and courteous
manner toward one another is one which values human dignity, while a society of people who
act in a hateful manner toward others clearly places a low value on respect for others and on
tolerance of other people's opinions and beliefs. In other respects, however, the way people
behave can belie their attitudes and values. For instance, a society whose members tend to
work long hours might appear to place a high value on work for its own sake, when in reality
these work habits might be born of financial necessity for these people, who would prefer more
leisure time if they could afford it.

Finally, the statement overlooks a crucial distinction between free societies and oppressed
ones. Free societies, such as contemporary America, are characterized by a panoply of rituals,
behaviors, and manners of dress among its members. Such diversity in appearances surely
indicates a society that places a high value on individual freedoms and cultural diversity.

Accordingly, it might seem that a society whose members share similar rituals, ways of
dressing, and public behaviors places a low value on individual freedoms and cultural diversity.

However, any student of modern Communism and Fascism would recognize cultural
homogeneity as an imposition on society's members, who would happily display their
preference for individuality and diversity but for their oppressors.

To sum up, while the statement has merit, it amounts to an unfair generalization. The way
that people look, dress, and act is often bred of necessity, not of attitude or values. And in
oppressed societies people's customs and habits belie their true attitudes and values in any
event.
