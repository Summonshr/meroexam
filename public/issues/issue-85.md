It is always an individual who is the impetus for innovation; the details may be worked out by a
team, but true innovation results from the enterprise and unique perception of an individual.

Some measure of consistency and stability in the law is critical for any society to function.

Otherwise, I strongly agree with the speaker's assertion that laws should be flexible enough to
adapt to different circumstances, times and places. The law of marital property apdy illustrates
this point.

On the one hand, a certain measure of consistency, stability, and predictability in our laws is
required in order for us to understand our legal obligations and rights as we go about our
day-to-day business as a society. For example, in order for private industry to thrive,
businesses must be afforded the security of knowing their legal rights and obligations visi-vis
employees, federal regulatory agencies, and tax authorities--as well as their contractual rights
and duties vis-~t-vis customers and suppliers. Undue uncertainty in any one of these areas
would surely have a chilling effect on business. Moreover, some measure of consistency in the
legal environment from place to place promotes business expansion as well as interstate and
international commerce, all of which are worthwhile endeavors in an increasingly mobile
society.

On the other hand, rigid laws can result in unfairness if applied inflexibly in all places at all
times. The framers of the U.S. Constitution recognized the need both for a flexible legal
system and for flexible laws--by affording each state legal jurisdiction over all but interstate
matters. The framers understood that social and economic problems, as well as standards of
equity and fairness, can legitimately change over time and vary from region to region----even
from town to town. And our nation's founders would be pleased to see their flexible system that
promotes equity and fairness as it operates today.

Consider, for example, marital property rights, which vary considerably from state to state,
and which have evolved considerably over time as inflexible, and unfair, systems have given
way to more flexible, fairer ones. In earlier times husbands owned all property acquired during
marriage as well as property brought into the marriage by either spouse. Understandably, this
rigid and unfair system ultimately gave way to separate-property systems, which
acknowledged property rights of both spouses. More recently certain progressive states have
adopted even more flexible, and fairer, **community property** systems, under which each
spouse owns half of all property acquired during the marriage, while each spouse retains a
separate-property interest in his or her other property. Yet even these more egalitarian
community-property systems can operate unfairly whenever spouses contribute unequally;
accordingly, some community-property states are now modifying their systems for even
greater flexibility and fairness.

Thus, the evolution of state marital-property laws aptly illustrates the virtue of a legal system
that allows laws to evolve to keep pace with changing mores, attitudes, and our collective
sense of equity. This same example also underscores the point that inflexible laws tend to
operate unfairly, and properly give way to more flexible ones--as our nation's founders
intended.
