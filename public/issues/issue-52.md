Issue 52
---------------------------

How children are socialized today determines the destiny of society. Unfortunately, we have
not yet learned how to raise children who can help bring about a better society.

I find the speaker's dual claim to be specious on both counts. The claim that society's
destiny hinges on how children are socialized, while appealing in some respects, is an
over-statement at best. And the claim that we have not yet learned how to raise children who
can better society is poorly supported by empirical evidence.

Consider first the speaker's assertion that society's destiny depends on how children are
socialized. I concede that unless a child is allowed sufficient opportunities for healthy
interaction with peers, that child is likely to grow into an ineffectual, perhaps even an anti-sodal,
adult. To witness healthy socialization in action, one need look no further than the school
playground, where children learn to negotiate, cooperate, and assert themselves in a
respectful manner, and where they learn about the harmful results of bullying and other
anti-social behavior. These lessons help children grow up to be good citizens and effective
leaders, as well as tolerant and respectful members of society.

However, socialization is only one factor influencing the extent to which an individual will
ultimately contribute to a better society. And in my observation it is not the most important one.

Consider certain prominent leaders who have contributed profoundly to a better society.

Mahatma Gandhi's contributions sprang primarily from the courage of his inner convictions, in
spite of his proper socialization among genteel Indian society and, as a law student, among
British society. Martin Luther King's contribution was primarily the result of his strong religious
upbringing, which had more to do with parental influence than with socialization. An even more
remarkable modern example was Theodore Roosevelt, whose social and physical
development were both stunted by life-threatening physical infirmities during his childhood. In
spite of his isolation, odd manner and aloofness throughout his early life, Roosevelt ascended
to a social-activist presidency by means of his will to overcome physical infLrmities, his
voracious appetite for knowledge, and his raw intellect.

Consider next the speaker's claim that we have not yet learned how to raise children who
can better society. Ifwe define a **better** society as one characterized by greater tolerance of
differing viewpoints and people who are different from ourselves, greater respect for individual
rights, and greater cooperation across cultural and national boundaries, then the children of
the most recent half-century are creating a better society. The most recent quarter-century has
seen an increasing sensitivity in our society toward ensuring public health by policing the food
and drug industries and by protecting our natural environment. We're becoming more sensitive
to, and respectful of, the rights of women, various ethnic and racial groups, homosexuals, and
mentally- and physically-challenged individuals. The re-emergence of political third parties with
decidedly libertarian ideals demonstrates an increasing concern for individual freedoms. And
there is ample evidence of increasing international cooperation. The former Soviet Union and
the U.S. have worked coUaboratively in space research and exploration since the 1970s;
peace-keeping missions are now largely multi-national efforts; and nations are now tackling
public health problems coUaboratively through joint research programs. In short, the speaker's
second claim flies in the face of the empirical evidence, as I see it.

In sum, when it comes to whether a child grows up to contribute to a better society, the key
determinant is not socialization but rather some other factor--such as a seminal childhood
event, parental influence, raw intelligence, or personal conviction. And, while reasonable
people with differing political and social viewpoints might disagree about what makes for a
**better** society, in my observation our society is steadily evolving into a more civilized,
respectful, and tolerant one. In the final analysis, then, I fundamentally disagree with both
aspects of the speaker's dual claim.
