**Contemporary art (painting, music, literature, etc.) is absent from the lives of most people,
since it is primarily created only for the enjoyment of other artists. Art should instead be
created purely for popular understanding and appreciation.**

This statement asserts that art, not the art critic, provides something of lasting value to
society. I strongly agree with the statement. Although the critic can help us understand and
appreciate art, more often than not, critique is either counterproductive to achieving the
objective of art or altogether irrelevant to that objective.

To support the statement the speaker might point out the three ostensible functions of the art
critic. First, critics can help us understand and interpret art; a critic who is familiar with a
particular artist and his or her works might have certain insights about those works that the
layperson would not. Secondly, a critic's evaluation of an art work serves as a filter, which
helps us determine which art is worth our time and attention. For example, a new novel by a
best-selling author might nevertheless be an uninspired effort, and if the critic can call our
attention to this fact we gain time to seek out more worthwhile literature to read. Thirdly, a critic
can provide feedback for artists; and constructive criticism, if taken to heart, can result in better
work.

However, reflecting on these three functions makes clear that the art critic actually offers
very little to society. The first function is better accomplished by docents and teachers, who are
more able to enhance a layperson's appreciation and understanding of art by providing an
objective, educated interpretation of it. Besides, true appreciation of art occurs at the moment
we encounter art; it is the emotional, even visceral impact that art has on our senses, spirits,
and souls that is the real value of art. A critic can actually provide a disservice by distracting us
from that experience.

The critic's second function that of evaluator who filters out bad art from the worthwhile is
one that we must be very wary of. History supports this caution. In the role of judge, critics
have failed us repeatedly. Consider, for example, Voltaire's rejection of Shakespeare as
barbaric because he did not conform to neo-classical principles of unity. Or, consider the
complete dismissal of Beethoven's music by the esteemed critics of his 6me. The art critic's
judgment is limited by the narrow confines of old and established parameters for evaluation.

Moreover, critical judgment is often misguided by the ego; thus its value is questionable in any
event.

I turn finally to the critic's third function: to provide useful feedback to artists. The value of
this function is especiaUy suspect. Any artist, or anyone who has studied art, would agree that
true art is the product of the artist's authentic passion, a manifestation of the artist's unique
creative impulse, and a creation of the artist's spirit. If art were shaped by the concern for
integrating feedback from ali criticism, it would become a viable craft, but at the same time
would cease to be art.

In sum, none of the ostensible functions of the critic are of much value at all, let alone of
lasting value, to society. On the other hand, the artist, through works of art, provides an
invaluable and unique mirror of the culture of the time during which the work was produced a
mirror for the artist's contemporaries and for future generations to gaze into for insight and
appreciation of history. The art critic in a subordinate role, more often than not, does a
disservice to society by obscuring this mirror.
