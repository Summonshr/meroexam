## Top 10 Ways to Raise Your Score

When it comes to taking the GRE, some test-taking skills will do you more good than others. There are concepts you can learn, techniques you can follow, and tricks you can use that will
help you to do your very best. Here’s our pick for the top 10 ways to raise your score:

**Create a study plan and follow it.** The right GRE study plan will help you get the most
out of this book in whatever time you have.

**Don’t get stuck on any one question.** Since you have to answer questions in order to
keep moving, you can’t afford to spend too much time on any one problem.

**Learn the directions in advance.** If you already know the directions, you won’t have to waste your precious test time reading them. You’ll be able to jump right in and start answering questions as soon as the test clock starts.

**In sentence completions, look for clue words.** These words will reveal the meaning
of the sentence and point you in the right direction.

**In analogy questions, a sentence can make the connection.** Analogies are about
word relationships. The best way to figure out the relationship is to summarize it in a
sentence.

**In reading comprehension, read for structure, not details.** When you read GRE
passages, don’t let the details bog you down. Most of the questions will ask about the
structure of the passage rather than specific facts. If you need the facts, they’re always
there in the passage. This is particularly important because you’ll probably have to scroll to read the entire passage.

**If a problem-solving math question stumps you, work backward from the
answers.** The right answer has to be one of the five choices. Since the choices are arranged in size order, starting with (C) results in the fewest calculations.

**In quantitative comparisons, consider all possibilities.** Think what would happen
if you plugged in 1, 0, a fraction, or a negative number for x in the expressions you’re
comparing.

**If math questions refer to a graph, avoid doing a lengthy calculation and save
valuable time by estimating.**

**For the Analytical Writing Measure, use the ARCO “templates” to craft essays that
satisfy the criteria that the GRE graders are trained to look for**
