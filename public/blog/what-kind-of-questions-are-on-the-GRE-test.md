## WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS ARE ON THE TEST?
The GRE includes verbal and mathematics sections in multiple-choice format plus the
essay part. Here’s a test description:

### Verbal Questions
* **Sentence Completions.** Sentence completion questions ask you to choose a word
or words that fill in the blanks in a given sentence.

* **Analogies**. Analogy questions present a pair of words that have some logical
relationship. Then the choices present other pairs of words. You have to choose the
pair that has the same kind of relationship as the first pair.

* **Reading** Comprehension. Reading comprehension questions relate to a passage
that is provided for you to read. The passage can be about almost anything, and the
questions about it test how well you understood the passage and the information
in it.

* **Antonyms**. Antonym questions present a single vocabulary word. You must pick
the answer choice that is most nearly opposite in meaning to the given word.

### Mathematics Questions

* **Quantitative Comparisons** Quantitative comparison questions test your skills
in comparing information and in estimating. You’ll see two quantities, one in
Column A and one in Column B. The task is to compare the two quantities and
decide if one is greater than the other, if they are equal, or if no comparison is
possible.

* **Problem Solving** Problem-solving questions present multiple-choice problems
in arithmetic, basic algebra, and elementary geometry. The task is to solve the
problems and choose the correct answer from among five answer choices.

* **Graphs**. Graph questions present mathematical information in pictorial form.
Each graph is followed by questions about it.

### Analytical Writing Assessment

* **Issue** Topic. The 45-minute “Present Your Perspective on an Issue” prompt asks
you to take a position on a topic of general interest and to then develop your opinion from any perspective that you choose.

* **Argument** Topic. The 30-minute “Analyze an Argument” topic requires you to
critique an argument by assessing the reasonableness of its assumptions, the
validity of its logic, and the reliability of its conclusion.
