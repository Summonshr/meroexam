Argument 80
---------------------------

*The following is a letter to the editor of the Roseville Gazette.*

**Despite opposition from some residents of West Roseville, the arguments in favor of merging
the townships of Roseville and West Roseville are overwhelming. First, residents in both
townships are confused about which authority to contact when they need a service; for
example, the police department in Roseville receives many calls from residents of West
Roseville. This sort of confusion would be eliminated with the merger. Second, the savings in
administrative costs would be enormous, since services would no longer be duplicated: we
would have only one fire chief, one tax department, one mayor, and so on. And no jobs in city
government would be lost---employees could simply be reassigned. Most importantly, the
merger will undoubtedly attract business investments as it did when the townships of Hamden
and North Hamden merged ten years ago.**


This editorial recommends the merger of Roseville and West RoseviUe. The author claims
that the merger would
* eliminate confusion among both townships' residents about which
authority to call for services;
* reduce aggregate administrative costs by eliminating
duplicative jobs and services, and
* attract business investment as did the merger of
Hamden and North Hamden ten years ago. The author claims further that the merger would
result in certain job reassignments but not in the loss of any jobs for current municipal
employees. I find these claims problematic in several respects.

First, although a merger might be necessary to eliminate current confusion about which
authority to contact for services, the editorial overlooks the possibility that the merger will not in
itself suffice to eliminate this confusion. Specifically, until the residents of both communities are
apprised of the change and learn how to respond appropriately, confusion will continue--and
perhaps even increase in the short term. Thus some measure of community awareness and
responsiveness might also be required for the elimination of confusion.

Secondly, the editorial seems to make two irreconcilable claims. One is that the merger will
result in the elimination of certain duplicative jobs; the other is that no current municipal
employee will become unemployed as a result of the merger. The editorial fails to consider that
eliminating duplicative jobs would decrease the aggregate number of current municipal
employees unless enough new jobs are created to offset the decrease, and that new jobs
would in turn add to administrative costs. Thus as it stands the argument is self-contradictory,
and the author must either modify it by choosing between two competing
objectives--preserving current employment levels and cutting costs---or somehow reconcile
these two objectives.

Thirdly, the author's claim that the merger will attract business investment relies on the hasty
assumption the newly merged Roseville would be similar to Hamden in every way affecting
their attractiveness to business investment. Perhaps Hamden's business tax rates, labor pool,
or even climate are more attractive than the newly merged Roseville's would be. If so, then the
proposed merger in itself might accomplish little toward attracting business investment to
RoseviUe. In other words, without evidence that Hamden and the newly merged Roseville
would be equally attractive to business investments I cannot accept the author's conclusion
that a merger will carry the same result for Roseville as for Hamden.

In sum, the editorial is not only logically unsound but also relies on several doubtful
assumptions. To strengthen the argument the author must modify the recommendation to
account for other measures needed to eliminate the confusion mentioned in the editorial. The
author must also provide a cost-benefit analysis that accounts for the costs of creating new
jobs to offset the elimination of duplicative jobs. FinaUy, the author must show that the new
RoseviUe would be just as attractive to business investment as the new Hamden has been.
