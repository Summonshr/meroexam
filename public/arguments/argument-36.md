Argument 36
---------------------------

*The following appeared in the editorial section of Monroetown's local newspaper.*

**Mayor Brown was recently re-elected by a clear majority of 52 percent of Monroetown's voters.
Her re-election, however, does not show that most people in our town favored Mayor Brown's
proposal for tax reduction over that of her opponent, Mr. Greene, who proposed raising taxes
to improve education. It has been shown that voters nationwide tend to re-elect people already
in office, regardless of candidates' proposals. In fact, a local survey after the election showed
most people in Monroetown disagreed with Mayor Brown's proposal. Clearly most people in
Monroetown favor improving education and therefore approve of Mr. Greene's proposal
despite the fact that they did not vote for him.**


The author of this editorial concludes that most Monroetown residents favor Greene's
proposal to raise taxes in order to improve education over Brown's proposal to cut taxes, even
though incumbent Brown defeated Greene by way of a 52O/o majority vote in a recent mayoral
election. To support this condusion the author points out a nationwide tendency to reelect
incumbent candidates regardless of their positions. The author also points out that a survey
taken after the election showed that most Monroetown residents oppose Brown's proposal. As
the following discussion shows, the author's argument is not well supported by the evidence.

First of all, the author unfairly assumes that the nationwide tendency applies specifically to
Monroetown residents. Lacking evidence that Monroetown voters reflect this general tendency,
it is entirely possible that Monroetown residents vote strictly according to their position on the
issues. For that matter, it is possible that Monroetown voters tend strongly to vote against
incumbents, in which case the author's claim that Monroetown residents oppose Brown's
proposal would more flagrantly fly in the face of the election results.

Secondly, the author fails to indicate when the statistics showing this nationwide tendency
were collected. The longer the time period between the collection of these statistics and the
election, the greater the possibility that the tendency has changed over this time span, and the
less justifiable the author's reliance on these statistics to support the claim that Monroetown
residents oppose Brown's proposal.

Thirdly, the author fails to indicate how much time passed between the Brown-Greene
election and the survey showing that most Monroetown residents oppose her proposal. If the
survey was conducted immediately after the election, then the fact that the election results
conflict with the survey results would cast considerable doubt on the reliability of either to
indicate what proposals Monroetown residents truly support. However, if the survey occurred
long after the election, then the conflict can readily be explained by changing opinions and
demographics over time. In either case, it is impossible to weigh the evidence without more
specific information about percentages. The larger the percentage of Monroetown residents
participating in the election, the greater the extent to which the election results would cast
doubt on the survey results. By the same token, the larger the percentage of Monroetown
residents shown by the survey to oppose Brown's proposal the more clearly this evidence
would support the author's argument.

Finally, the argument suffers from **either-or** reasoning. Based on the fact that Monroetown
residents are opposed to Brown's proposed tax cut, the author unfairly concludes that they
must be in favor of Greene's proposal. However, the author overlooks the possibility that
Monroetown residents are not in favor of either proposal.

In sum, the author's argument that Monroetown residents oppose Brown's proposal and are
in favor of the proposals set forth by Greene is unconvincing. To strengthen the argument the
author must provide clear evidence that Monroetown residents voted contrary to their own
positions on the issues when they reelected Brown. To better evaluate the argument I would
need to know how much time passed between the collection of the statistics showing the
national tendency cited by the author and the election. I would also need to know how much
time passed between the election and the survey showing that Monroetown residents oppose
Brown's proposal. Finally, I would need to know what portion of Monroetown's residents voted
in the election, and what portion of these residents were shown by the survey to oppose
Brown's policies.
