Argument 86
---------------------------

**The citizens of Forsythe have adopted healthier lifestyles. Their responses to a recent survey
show that in their eating habits they conform more closely to government nutritional
recommendations than they did ten years ago. Furthermore, there has been a fourfold
increase in sales of food products containing kiran, a substance that a scientific study has
shown reduces cholesterol. This trend is also evident in reduced sales of sulia, a food that few
of the healthiest citizens regularly eat.**

In this argument the speaker concludes that Forsythe citizens have adopted healthier
lifestyles. To justify this contusion the speaker cites a recent survey of Forsythe citizens
suggesting that their eating habits now conform more closely to government nutritional
recommendations than they did ten years ago. The speaker also points out that sales of tdran,
a substance known to reduce cholesterol, have increased fourfold, while sales of sulia, which
few of Forsythe's healthiest citizens eat regularly, have been declining. This argument is
unpersuasive for several reasons.

First, the survey must be shown to be reliable before I can accept any contusions based
upon it. Specifically, the responses must be accurate, and the respondents must be statistically
significant in number and representative of the overall Forsythe citizenry in terms of eating
habits. Without evidence of the survey's reliability, it is impossible to draw any firm conclusions
about the current dietary habits of Forsythe citizens based on the survey.

Second, the argument relies on the dubious assumption that following the government's
nutrition recommendations promotes health to a greater extent than following any other
nutrition regime. It is entirely possible that the dietary habits of Forsythe citizens were healthier
ten years ago than they are now. Thus without evidence to substantiate this assumption the
speaker cannot reasonably conclude that the diet of Forsythe's citizens has become more
nutritional.

Third, the speaker assumes too hastily that increasing sales of products with kiran indicates
healthier eating habits. Perhaps Forsythe citizens are eating these foods in amounts or at
intervals that undermine the health benefits of kiran. Without ruling out this possibility the
speaker cannot reasonably conclude with any confidence that increased kiran consumption
has resulted in improved health for Forsythe's citizens.

Fourth, the mere fact that few of Forsythe's healthiest citizens eat sulia regularly does not
mean that sulia is detrimental to health as the speaker assumes. It is possible that sulia has
no effect on health, or that it actually promotes health. Lacking firm evidence that sulia affects
health adversely, and that healthy people avoid sulia for this reason, the speaker cannot justify
any conclusions about the health of Forsythe's citizens from the mere fact that sulia sales are
declining.

Finally, even if the dietary changes to which the speaker refers are healthful ones, the
speaker overlooks the possibility that Forsythe citizens have been making other changes in
their dietary or other habits that offset these healthful changes. Unless all other habits affecting
health have remained unchanged, the speaker cannot justifiably conclude that the overall
lifestyle of Forsythe's citizenry has become healthier.

In sum, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the speaker must show
that the survey accurately reflects the dietary habits of Forsythe's citizens, and that by
following the government's nutritional recommendations more closely these citizens are in fact
healthier. The speaker must also show that Forsythe's citizens have not made other dietary or
other lifestyle changes that offset healthful changes. Finally, to better assess the argument I
would need more information about the manner and extent to which Forsythe's citizens now
consume kiran, and about the healthfulness of sulia.
