Argument 97
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memorandum to faculty from the academic vice president of
Waymarsh University.*

**So that we can better accomplish Waymarsh University's academic goals, we should adopt
the job-opportunity (job-op) program offered at Plateau Technical College and strongly
encourage all students at Waymarsh to participate in it. The success of the job-op program at
Plateau is evident: over the past two years, more than 75% of the freshmen at Plateau have
enrolled in the optional job-op program. Moreover, at Plateau, the grades of job-op students
are consistently higher than those of other students, 90% of the job-op students receive job
offers within a month after their graduation, and most former job-op students report much
success in their careers.**


In this memo a Waymarsh University administrator recommends that in order to achieve its
academic goals Waymarsh should adopt the same **job-op** program currently offered at
Plateau Technical College. To support this recommendation, the administrator points out a
high enrollment rate in the program at Plateau, high academic grades among Plateau students
enrolled in the program compared to other Plateau students, and a high success rate among
new Plateau graduates in finding jobs. The administrator's argument is unconvincing for
several reasons.

First of all, the administrator does not inform us what Waymarsh's academic goals are. It is
entirely possible that these goals have nothing to do with enrollment in job opportunity
programs or in the job-placement rate for new graduates. Although Plateau's goals are likely to
depend on its job-placement rate, perhaps Waymarsh's primary goal is to prepare its students
for graduate-level study. Even if Waymarsh's goals involve job placement, there might be
alternative means of accomplishing those goals. In short, without identifying Waymarsh's goals
and ruling out other possible means of attaining them, the administrator cannot justifiably
conclude that Waymarsh should adopt the job-op program.

Secondly, the fact that a high percentage of Plateau students enroll in Plateau's job-op
program does not mean that a large portion of Waymarsh students will also enroll in the
program. Plateau students might be far more concerned about obtaining employment
immediately after graduation than Waymarsh students are. The fact that Plateau is a two-year
technical college while Waymarsh is a university supports this assertion.

Thirdly, the fact that Plateau students enrolled in the job-op program attain higher grades than
other Plateau students does not necessarily mean that the job-op program is responsible for
this phenomenon. Perhaps only the brighter, more competitive Plateau students enroll in the
job-op program in the first place. Without ruling out this possibility, the administrator cannot
convincingly conclude that Waymarsh students who enroll in the job-op program are more
likely to attain better grades or find jobs upon graduation. In fact, a job-op program might
actually thwart Waymarsh's efforts, by encouraging enrollees to quit school and take jobs for
which a four-year degree is not needed.

Finally, the administrator overlooks the possibility that the job-op program is oriented toward
the needs of students at technical schools. A job-op program that successfully places technical
students might not be as successful in placing graduates of four-year universities, because the
types of jobs the two groups of graduates typically seek and would qualify for are quite
different.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the administrator
must show that one of Waymarsh's academic goals is to place its new graduates in jobs. The
administrator must also show that this job-op program is equally successful in placing
university graduates as it is in placing technical-school graduates. To better evaluate the
argument we would need more information about the extent to which the job-opprogram is
actually responsible for the successful job placement rate among Plateau's graduates.
