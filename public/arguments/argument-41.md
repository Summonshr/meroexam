Argument 41
---------------------------

*The following is from an editorial in the Midvale Observer, a local newspaper.*

**Ever since the 1950's, when television sets began to appear in the average home, the rate of
crimes committed by teenagers in the country of Alta has steadily increased. This increase in
teenage crime parallels the increase in violence shown on television. According to several
national studies, even very young children who watch a great number of television shows
featuring violent scenes display more violent behavior within their home environment than do
children who do not watch violent shows. Furthermore, in a survey conducted by the Observer,
over 90 percent of the respondents were parents who indicated that prime-time
television--programs that are shown between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.---should show less violence.
Therefore, in order to lower the rate of teenage crime in Alta, television viewers should
demand that television programmers reduce the amount of violence shown during prime time.**


This editorial concludes that increasingly violent television programming during prime time in
the country of Alta is responsible for the steady increase in violent crime among Alta's
teenagers. To support this conclusion the editorial cites various statistical studies about
violence on television. However, this evidence provides little credible support for the editorial's
conclusion.

To begin with, the editorial observes a correlation between violence on television and violent
teenage crime, then concludes that the former is the cause of the latter. However, the editorial
fails to rule out other possible explanations for the rise in violent crime among teenagers. For
example, since the 1950s it is entirely possible that Alta has seen a large growth in its
population, or a deterioration of its juvenile justice system or economy. Any of these factors, or
other social, political or economic factors, might lead to an increase in violent crime among
teenagers. Without ruling out all other such factors it is unfair to conclude that television
programs are responsible for this increase.

Next, the editorial cites studies showing that young children exposed to violent images are
more likely to behave violently in the home. This evidence would support the editorial's
conclusion only if teenagers and younger children react similarly to television. However,
common sense tells me that young children are more likely than teenagers to mimic observed
behavior. Moreover, the editorial fails to provide any evidence that this sort of mimicry
ultimately develops into violent criminal behavior.

The editorial then cites the Observer survey in which **90% of the respondents were parents**
who would prefer less violent television programming during prime time. However, the editorial
fails to provide any information about the survey population; therefore it is impossible to
determine whether the survey results apply generally to the Alta population. In addition, we are
not informed how many parents were surveyed but did not respond. The greater this number,
the less reliable the survey. Thus, as it stands the Observer study is statistically unreliable and
lends no credible support to the editorial's conclusion.

Aside from the survey's statistical unreliability, in citing the survey the editorial assumes that
parents' preferences about television programming have some bearing on whether their
teenage children will commit violent crimes. However, the editorial provides no evidence to link
one with the other. Moreover, the survey is relevant only to the extent that teenagers watch
television during prime time. However, the editorial provides no evidence about this extent.

In conclusion, the editorial is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen the argument, the
editorial's author must rule out all other possible factors contributing to the rise in teenage
violence. The author must also show that teenagers react to violent television images similarly
to how younger children react to the same images, and that Alta teenagers watch a significant
amount of television programming during prime time. In order to better evaluate the argument,
we would need more information about the Observer survey population, and about the
percentage of those surveyed who responded.
