Argument 58
---------------------------

**For the past five years, consumers in California have been willing to pay twice as much for
oysters from the northeastern Atlantic Coast as for Gulf Coast oysters. This trend began
shortly after harmful bacteria were found in a few raw Gulf Coast oysters. But scientists have
now devised a process for killing the bacteria. Once consumers are made aware of the
increased safety of Gulf Coast oysters, they are likely to be willing to pay as much for Gulf
Coast as for northeastern Atlantic Coast oysters, and greater profits for Gulf Coast oyster
producers will follow.**

This argument points out that, ever since harmful bacteria were found in a few Gulf Coast
oysters five years ago, California consumers have been willing to pay twice as much for
northeastern Atlantic oysters as for Gulf oysters. The argument then notes that scientists have
now developed a process for killing these bacteria. The argument concludes that once
consumers become aware of this fact they will be willing to pay as much for these oysters as
for Atlantic oysters, and that profits for Gulf oyster producers will thereby increase. The
argument is flawed in three critical respects.

First, the argument assumes that the bacteria discovery is the reason for California
consumers' unwillingness to pay as much for Gulf shrimp during the past five years. However,
this is not necessarily so. Perhaps regional culinary tastes shifted during the last five years,
and perhaps Atlantic oysters have a distinct taste, texture, size, or other quality that has made
them more popular among California consumers. Since the argument fails to rule out this and
other alternative explanations for the willingness of California consumers to pay more for
Atlantic oysters, the argument's conclusion is unwarranted.

Secondly, the argument assumes too hastily that consumer awareness of the process that
kills the bacteria will necessarily result in the behavior that the argument predicts. Perhaps
after five years of favoring Atlantic oysters, consumer oyster tastes and habits have become so
well entrenched that consumers will continue to favor Atlantic oysters and will happily pay a
premium for them. Moreover, in my observation consumers often act unpredictably and
irrationally, and therefore any prediction about consumer preferences is dubious at best.

Besides, it is entirely possible that Gulf oyster producers will be unwilling to employ the new
bacteria-killing process; if so, and if consumers are aware of this fact, then in all likelihood
consumers will continue to favor Atlantic oysters.

Thirdly, even if consumers begin paying as much for Gulf oysters once they become aware of
the bacteria-killing process, the argument's conclusion that Gulf oyster producers will enjoy
increased profits as a result is unwarranted. Profit is a factor of not only revenue but also costs.

It is entirely possible that the costs of employing this new process for killing bacteria, or other
costs associated with producing Gulf oysters, will offset additional revenue. Besides, a myriad
of other possible occurrences, such as unfavorable regional weather or economic conditions,
might prevent the Gulf oyster producers from being as profitable in the foreseeable future as
the argument predicts.

In sum, the argument is unpersuasive as it stands. To strengthen it the argument's
proponent must consider and rule out all other possible explanations for the willingness of
California consumers to pay a premium for Atlantic oysters, and must convince me that with
consumer awareness of the bacteria-killing process Gulf oysters will become just as desirable
as Atlantic oysters. To better assess the argument's claim that profits for Gulf oyster producers
will increase as an end result, I would need to know whether Gulf oyster producers will incur
the expenses involved in killing the bacteria and, if so, the extent to which these expenses will
impinge on the producers' profits.
