Argument 96
---------------------------

*The following is a letter to the editor of a news magazine.*

**Clearly, the successful use of robots on missions to explore outer space in the past 20 years
demonstrates that robots could be increasingly used to perform factory work more effectively,
efficiently, and profitably than human factory workers. The use of robots in factories would offer
several advantages. First, robots never get sick, so absenteeism would be reduced. Second,
robots do not make mistakes, so factories would increase their output. Finally, the use of
robots would also improve the morale of factory workers, since factory work can be so boring
that many workers would be glad to shift to more interesting kinds of tasks.**


This editorial concludes that using robots for factory work would improve factory efficiency.

To justify this conclusion the editorial's author cites the fact that robots have been used
effectively in many space missions. Also, the author claims that the use of robots in factories
would
* reduce absenteeism because robots never get sick,
* improve output because
robots do not make errors, and
* improve factory-worker morale because these workers
could be reassigned to less boring jobs. However, the author's argument is problematic in
several critical respects.

To begin with, the argument depends on the hasty assumption that the kinds of tasks robots
perform in space are similar to the ones they would perform in factories, and that there are no
differences between the two environments that would render robots less effective in factory
jobs than in space missions. Perhaps the effectiveness of robots in space missions is due
largely to the weightless environment of space. Or perhaps the average space-mission robot
performs less work than a typical factory robot would be required to perform. In either case, the
fact that robots are effective in space would amount to scant support the author's argument.

As for the author's claim that the use of robots would decrease absenteeism, although
robots clearly do not get sick, in all likelihood factory robots would break down from time to
time which is tantamount to absenteeism. Without accounting for this likelihood the author
cannot rely on this claim to condude that the use of robots would improve overall factory
efficiency. Also questionable is the author's claim that the use of robots would increase factory
output because robots do not make errors. Unless the author can provide clear evidence that
human errors result in a lower rate of factory output, and not just a lower quality of product, I
cannot be convinced that using robots would in fact increase the rate of output.

Two final problems involve the author's claim that using robots would improve the morale of
factory workers, thereby improving factory effidency. First, the author provides no assurances
that if factory workers are reassigned to other types of jobs their morale would improve as a
result. Although the new jobs might be less boring, these jobs might pose other problems
which would adversely affect worker morale. Secondly, even if the morale of the workers
improves as a result of reassignment, overall factory efficiency will not necessarily improve as
a result. These workers might be ill-suited for their new jobs and thus be extremely ineffective
in them.

In sum, the editorial relies on a potentially weak analogy as well as on a series of
unwarranted claims. To strengthen the argument that the use of robots would improve factory
efficiency, the editorial's author must at the very least provide clear evidence that factory
robots would perform the same types of tasks, and just as well, as the tasks robots have
performed in space missions. To better assess the strength of each of the author's three
unwarranted claims, respectively, I would need to know:
* the expected downtime i.e.,
absenteeism--for factory robots:
* the extent to which human error decreases the rate of
factory output; and
* the extent to which human factory workers would be happy and
effective in the new jobs to which they would be assigned.
