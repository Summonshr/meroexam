Argument 53
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a business magazine.*

**As a result of numerous consumer complaints of dizziness and nausea, Promofoods
requested that eight million cans of tuna be returned for testing last year. Promofoods
concluded that the cans did not, after all, contain chemicals that posed a health risk. This
conclusion is based on the fact that the chemists from Promofoods tested samples of the
recalled cans and found that, of the eight chemicals most commonly blamed for causing
symptoms of dizziness and nausea, five were not found in any of the tested cans. The
chemists did find that the three remaining suspected chemicals are naturally found in all other
kinds of canned foods.**


This magazine article concludes that the 8 million cans of tuna Promofoods recalled, due to
complaints about nausea and dizziness, do not after ail contain any chemicals that pose a
health risk. To support this conclusion the author cites the fact that five of eight chemicals
commonly causing these symptoms were not found in the recalled cans, while the other three
also occur naturally in other canned foods. For several reasons, this evidence lends little
credible support to the author's conclusion.

To begin with, the author relies partly on the fact that, although three of the eight chemicals
most commonly blamed for nausea and dizziness appeared in Promofoods' recalled tuna,
these chemicals also occur naturally in other canned foods. However, this fact alone lends no
support to the author's conclusion, for two reasons. First, the author might be ignoring an
important distinction between **naturally occurring** chemicals and those not occurring naturally.

It is entirely possible that these three chemicals do not occur naturally in Promofoods' tuna,
and that it is for this reason that the chemicals cause nausea and dizziness. Secondly, it is
entirely possible that even when they occur naturally these chemicals cause the same
symptoms. Unless the author rules out both possibilities, he cannot reliably conclude that the
recalled tuna would not cause these symptoms.

Another problem with the argument is that the author's conclusion is too broad. Based on
evidence about certain chemicals that might cause two particular heath-related symptoms, the
author concludes that the recalled tuna contains no chemicals that pose a health risk. However,
the author fails to account for the myriad of other possible health risks that the recalled tuna
might potentially pose. Without ruling out all other such risks, the author cannot justifiably
reach his conclusion.

A third problem with the argument involves that fact that the eight particular chemicals with
which the test was concerned are only the eight **most commonly blamed** for nausea and
dizziness. It is entirely possibly that other chemicals might also cause these symptoms, and
that one or more of these other chemicals actually caused the symptoms. Without ruling out
this possibility, the author cannot jusufiably conclude that the recalled tuna would not cause
nausea and dizziness.

A final problem with the argument involves thetesting procedure itself. The author provides
no information about the number of recaUed cans tested or the selection method used. Unless
the number of cans is a sufficiently large sample and is statistically repre sentative of all the
recalled cans, the study's results are not statistically reliable.

In conclusion, the article is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen the assertion that the
recalled tuna would not cause nausea and dizziness, the author must provide evidence that
the three chemicals mentioned that occur naturally in other canned foods also appear naturally
in Promofoods' tuna. The author must also provide evidence that ingesting other canned foods
containing these three chemicals does not cause these symptoms. To better evaluate the
argument, we would need to know whether the sample used in the tests was statistically
significant and representative of all the recalled tuna. We would also need to know what other
chemicals in the recalled tuna might pose any health risk at all.
