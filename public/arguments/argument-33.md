Argument 33
---------------------------

**A new study collected data that shows that people who snore are more likely to gain weight
than are people who do not snore. It is well known that many people who snore also stop
breathing frequently during the night for a few seconds, a condition called sleep apnea. The
interruption of breathing wakes the person---often so briefly that the waking goes
unnoticed---and can leave the person too tired during the day to exercise. Anyone who snores,
therefore, should try to eat less than the average person and to exercise more
In this argument the speaker concludes that any person who snores should try to eat less
and exercise more than the average person. To justify this conclusion the speaker points out
that many snorers awaken frequently during sleep--often so briefly that they are unaware that
they are awake in order to catch their breath (a condition called sleep apnea), and as a result
are too fired during normal waking hours to exercise. The speaker also cites data collected
during a recent study, suggesting that snorers are more likely to gain weight than other people.**

This argument is flawed in several critical respects.

First, the speaker provides no assurances that the recently collected data suggesting a
correlation between snoring and weight gain are statistically reliable. Perhaps the study's
subjects were unrepresentative of the overall population in terms of other traits and habits
that might affect body weight. Lacking such evidence the speaker simply cannot draw any firm
conclusions based on the study about the relationship between snoring and weight gain.

Even assuming a strong correlation between snoring and weight gain among the general
population, the speaker has not adequately shown that sleep apnea causes weight gain. A
correlation is one indication of a causal relationship, but in itself does not suffice to prove such
a relationship. It is entirely possible that some other medical condition, or some other trait or
habit, that causes snoring also causes weight gain. Without establishing dearly that snoring at
least contributes to weight gain, the speaker cannot convince me that snorers should either eat
less or exercise more than the average person.

Even ifmany snorers suffer from sleep apnea and tend to gain weight as a result, the
speaker's advice that **anyone who snores** should try to eat less and to exercise is new
ertheless unwarranted. It is entirely possible that some--or perhaps even most--snorers do not
suffer from sleep apnea, or are not too tired to exercise, or do not in any event tend to gain
weight. Without ruling out these possibilities, the speaker must expressly limit the advice to
those snorers whose snoring causes weight-gain.

Even if the speaker's advice were modified as indicated above, the advice to exercise would
still be logically unsound. If a person with sleep apnea is too tired to exercise as a result, then
simply advising that person to exercise begs the question: What should the person do to
eliminate the cause of the tiredness? Thus the speaker should determine the cause of sleep
apnea and modify the advice so that it targets that cause. Of course, ifit turns out that weight
gain is one cause of snoring and sleep apnea, then the speaker's advice that snorers should
try to eat less would have considerable merit. Yet, without any evidence that this is the case,
the speaker's advice might be at least partially ineffective in counteracting a snorer's tendency
to gain weight.

In sum, the speaker's advice for **any** snorer is ill-conceived and poorly supported. To lend
credibility to this advice the speaker should provide evidence that the recently collected data
reflect the general population. To better assess the argument it would be useful to know all the
possible causes of snoring and of sleep apnea.
