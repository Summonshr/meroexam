Argument 103
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a brochure promoting the purchase of local franchises for a national
chain of gyms.*

**Now is the time to invest in a Power-Lift Gym franchise so that you can profit from opening
one of our gyms in your town. Consider the current trends: Power-Lift Gyms are already
popular among customers in 500 locations, and national surveys indicate increasing concern
with weight loss and physical fitness. Furthermore, last year's sales of books and magazines
on personal health totaled more than $50 million, and purchases of home exercise equipment
almost doubled. Investing now in a Power-Lift Gym franchise will guarantee a quick profit.**


This brochure for Power-Lift Gym da/ms that by investing in a Power-Lift franchise an
investor will earn a quick profit. To support this claim the brochure cites a variety of statistics
about the current popularity of physical fitness and of Power-Lift Gyms in particular. However,
careful scrutiny of this evidence reveals that it lends no credible support to the claim.

One problem with the brochure's claim involves its reliance on the bare fact that revenue
from last year's sales of health books and magazines totaled $50 million. This statistic in itself
proves nothing. Health magazines do not all focus on weightlifting or even physical fitness; it is
possible that very few sales were of those that do. Besides, it is entirely possible that in
previous years total sales were even higher and that sales are actually declining. Either
scenario, if true, would serve to weaken the brochure's claim rather than support it.

Another problem with brochure's claim involves the fact that more and more consumers are
purchasing home gyms. It is entirely possible that consumers are using home gyms as a
substitute for commercial gyms, and that the number of Power-Lift memberships will decline as
a result. Without ruling out this possibility, the brochure cannot convince me that a new
Power-Lift franchise would be profitable.

A third problem with the brochure's claim involves its reliance on the fact that 500 Power-Lift
franchises are now in existence. It is entirely possible that the market has become saturated,
and that additional Power-Lift gyms will not be as successful as current ones. Moreover, it is
possible that the number of competing gyms has also increased in tandem with the general
interest in health and fitness. Without addressing this supply-and-demand issue, the brochure
cannot justify its conclusion that a new Power-Lift fran- chise would be a sound investment.

In conclusion, the brochure is unpersuasive as it stands. To strengthen its daim that a new
Power-Lift franchise would be profitable, the brochure should provide stronger evidence that
the general interest in physical fitness, and weightlifting in particular, will continue unabated in
the foreseeable furore. The brochure must also provide evidence that home gyms are not
serving as substitutes for commercial gyms. Finally, to better evaluate the argument we would
need more information about the extent to which the fitness-gym market has become
saturated, not only by Power-Lift franchises but by com peting gyms as well.
