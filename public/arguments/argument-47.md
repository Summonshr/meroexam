Argument 47
---------------------------

**The nation of Claria covers a vast physical area. But despite wide geographic differences,
many citizens are experiencing rising costs of electricity. A recent study of household electric
costs in Claria found that families who cooled their houses with fans alone spent more on
electricity than did families using air conditioners alone for cooling. However, those households
that reported using both fans and air conditioners spent less on electricity than those
households that used either fans or air conditioners alone. Thus, the citizens of Claria should
follow the study's recommendation and use both air conditioners and fans in order to save
money on electricity.**

This argument recommends that all citizens of Claria should mn fans as well as air
conditioners, for the purpose of saving money on electricity. To support this recommendation,
the argument's proponent points out that Claria citizens who run only fans incur higher electric
costs than those who mn only air conditioners, and that those who run both incur the lowest
electric costs among the three groups. However, the argument depends on certain dubious
assumptions about climate, electric costs, and the cited statistics. As a result, the
recommendation is iU-conceived.

First, the argument relies on the assumption that climatic conditions are similar throughout
all regions of Claria. Yet this is probably not the case, especially since the passage explicitly
characterizes Claria as vast and widely diverse geographically. It is entirely possible that only
fans are used in certain regions because the climate in these regions is comparatively cold
year-round, and that electric heating costs are so high that they result in the highest overall
electric costs in the country. If this is the case, implementing the proponent's suggestion would
result in higher electric costs for citizens in these regions. Or perhaps people who run both
fans and air conditioners live in regions where there is less need for artificial cooling. This
would explain why total electric costs in these regions are comparatively low. If this is the case,
then implementing the proponent's suggestion might still result in higher electric costs for
citizens in other regions.

Secondly, the recommendation depends on the assumption that the cost of electricity is the
same for all three groups. However, it is possible that people who use both fans and air
conditioners incur the lowest total electric costs among the three groups simply because these
people pay the least per unit of electricity. The fact that Claria is geographically diverse lends
support to this notion; people who use both fans and air conditioners are likely to live in the
same climatic region, and people in the same region are more likely to be subject to the same
electricity usage rates.

Thirdly, the argument provides insufficient information about the study on which it relies. If the
results were based on only one warm season then the argument would be less persuasive
than if the results were based on more than one warm season; in other words, the larger the
statistical sample the more reliable the results.

In condusion, the recommendation for using both cooling methods is dubious at best. To
bolster it, the argument's proponent must show that climatic conditions are similar in all regions.

The proponent must also show that rates charged for electricity are similar in all regions.

Finally, in order to better evaluate the extent to which the cited study supports the
recommendation we would need more statistical information about the study's time span.
