Argument 73
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a letter from the owner of the Sunnyside Towers apartment building
to its manager.*

**One month ago, all the showerheads on the first five floors of Sunnyside Towers were
modified to restrict the water flow to approximately 1/3 of its original force. Although actual
readings of water usage before and after the adjustment are not yet available, the change will
obviously result in a considerable savings for Sunnyside Corporation, since the corporation
must pay for water each month. Except for a few complaints about low water pressure, no
problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment. Clearly, restricting water flow
throughout all the 20 floors of Sunnyside Towers will increase our profits further.**


In this letter, the owner of an apartment building concludes that low-flow shower heads
should be installed in showers on all 20 floors of the building, for the purpose of saving money.

To support this conclusion, the owner cites the fact that since installing low-flow heads in
showers on the bottom five floors only a few tenants have complained about low water
pressure, and that no other problems with showers have been reported. However, this
evidence provides little credible support for the owner's argument, as discussed below.

In the first place, the argument depends on the assumption that installation of low-flow
heads on the first five floors has resulted in lower water costs for the owner. However, this
need not be the case. It is equally possible that tenants on these floors compensate for lower
flow by either taking longer showers or by opening their shower valves further than they would
otherwise. It is also possible that water pressure, and therefore water usage, on the remaining
floors has increased as a result. It is even possible that during the month since installation
many of the tenants on the bottom five floors have been absent from the building, and this fact
explains why few tenants have complained.

In the second place, the owner ignores possible indirect consequences of installing lowflow
shower heads on all 20 floors--consequences that in turn might adversely affect the owner's
net operating income. For example, the more low-flow installations the more likely that one or
more tenants will become disgruntled and vacate as a result. In fact, the owner has admitted
that at least a few tenants have complained about these new shower heads. High tenant
turnover might very well serve to increase the owner's overall operating costs.

In the third place, in order to reasonably conclude that low-flow heads will reduce total water
usage in the building the owner must assume that other water uses will remain constant in the
future. However, this will not necessarily be the case. Perhaps the water supplier will raise
rates, or perhaps current tenants will be replaced by other tenants who use more water.

Without ruling out such possibilities the owner cannot justifiably conclude that his total water
costs will decrease after installing low-flow heads in every shower.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the owner must
provide clear evidence that the use of a low-flow shower head in fact reduces total water
usage. To better assess the argument we would need figures comparing water usage before
and after installation. We would also need to know how many of the bottom five floors were
occupied since the new heads were installed, and whether the tenants on these floors are
likely to use more or less water than tenants on the upper floors.
