Argument 109
---------------------------

*The following appeared as part of a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.*

**During her three years in office, Governor Riedeburg has shown herself to be a worthy leader.

Since she took office, crime has decreased, the number of jobs created per year has doubled,
and the number of people choosing to live in our state has increased. These trends are likely
to continue if she is reelected. In addition, Ms. Riedeburg has promised to take steps to keep
big companies here, thereby providing jobs for any new residents. Anyone who looks at Ms.

Riedeburg's record can tell that she is the best-qualified candidate for governor.**


This letter concludes that Governor Riedeburg is the best-qualified candidate for the job of
state governor. To justify this conclusion the letter points out various statewide trends since the
governor was elected, and the fact that she has promised to keep big companies in the state,
thereby providing jobs for any new residents. However, close scrutiny of the argument reveals
various logical problems, which render it unconvincing.

One problem with the argument is that the letter's author might be assigning a false cause to
these statewide trends. The author provides no evidence that Riedeburg's policies and actions
as governor were indeed the reason for these developments. Without such evidence, it is
equally possible that other factors are instead responsible for the trends. For instance, perhaps
the crime rate has declined due to legislative or judicial action over which Riedeburg had no
control. Perhaps the rise in the state's population is the result of sociological trends that have
nothing to do with Riedeburg's policies as governor. Or perhaps people are moving to the state
for other reasons, such as the state's climate. Moreover, the argument assumes that an
increase in population is a positive development in the first place; yet it is entirely possible that
the state's residents properly view this trend as a negative one. If so, and if Riedeburg's
policies have contributed to this trend, then the author cannot reasonably conclude based on
this evidence that Riedeburg is the best-qualified candidate.

Another problem with the argument involves Riedeburg's promise to keep big compariles in
the state, thereby providing jobs for any new residents. Assuming that Riedeburg keeps her
promise in the first place, the author provides no evidence that these employers would be
either willing or able to hire new residents. Perhaps these employers plan to curtail new hiring
in any event; or perhaps they plan to hire new employees only among current state residents.

Moreover, whether these employers are able to hire new employees depends on a variety of
extrinsic economic factors over which Riedeburg might have no control. Without accounting for
these possibilities, the author cannot rely on Riedeburg's promise to conclude that she is the
best-qualified candidate for the job of state governor.

Finally, the author's conclusion that Riedeburg is **the best-qualified candidate** raises two
problems in itself. First, regardless of Riedeburg's record as governor it is entirely possible that
one or more other candidates are actually better qualified. Second, the letter fails to
adequately define what makes a candidate for state governor qualified. Without indicating
what the ideal qualifications would be and ruling out the possibility that an other candidate
better meets these qualifications, the author cannot make a convincing case that Riedeburg is
the best-qualified candidate.

In conclusion, the argument is unpersuasive as it stands. To strengthen it the author must
provide clear evidence that it was Riedeburg who was responsible for the currents trends, and
that the current population trend is desirable in the first place. The author must also show that
the state's major employers would be willing and able to hire new residents in the future.

Finally, to better evaluate the argument we would need more information about what defines
an ideal governor and how well other candidates meet that definition.
