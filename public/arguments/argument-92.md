Argument 92
---------------------------

**It is known that in recent years, industrial pollution has caused the Earth's ozone layer to thin,
allowing an increase in the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches the Earth's surface. At
the same time, scientists have discovered, the population of a species of salamander that lays
its eggs in mountain lakes has declined. Since ultraviolet radiation is known to be damaging to
delicate tissues and since salamander eggs have no protective shells, it must be the case that
the increase in ultraviolet radiation has damaged many salamander eggs and prevented them
from hatching. This process will no doubt cause population declines in other species, just as it
has in the salamander species.**

In this argument the speaker claims that increased ultraviolet radiation due to thinning of the
Earth's ozone layer is responsible for the significant decline in the number of salamanders who
lay their eggs in mountain lakes, and that this thinning will cause population declines in other
species. To justify these claims the speaker points out that salamander eggs lack a protective
shell and thus their tissues are highly susceptible to radiation damage, then reasons that the
increased radiation must damage these eggs and prevent them from hatching. The argument
is problematic in several critical respects, which render it unconvincing.

To begin with, the argument assumes that the salamander population is in fact declining, yet
this assumption is not bom out by the mere fact that the number of salamanders laying eggs in
mountain lakes is declining. It is entirely possible that in other locations the salamander
population is increasing. For that matter, perhaps the number of eggs a salamander lays in a
mountain lake is increasing on average. Either scenario, if true, would seriously call into
question any prediction about population changes for salamanders or for other species.

Even if the total salamander population is declining, an inverse correlation between
ultraviolet radiation and salamander population does not suffice in itself to prove that the
former causes the latter. The speaker must account for the possibility that the number of eggs
salamanders lay is declining in all areas--regardless of the amount of radiation reaching the
surface. The speaker must also eliminate all other reasonable explanations for the decline. For
example, if the population of species that prey on salamanders or eat their eggs is increasing,
this would explain the population decline and therefore undermine the speaker's entire
argument.

Even assuming that the total salamander population is declining as a result of increasing
radiation, the speaker cannot reasonably infer that other species are equally vulnerable to a
population decline as a result. Perhaps the absence of a shell, combined with its
mountain-lake location, renders a salamander egg more vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation than
any other type of egg. If so, this fact would cast considerable doubt on the speaker's prediction
for other species.

Finally, the speaker's grave prediction relies on the assumption that the ozone-thinning
process will not reverse in the future. Although this assumption might be born out, on the other
hand it might not. Without providing some assurance that the ozone layer will at least continue
to be as thin as it is now, the speaker cannot convince me that other species will experience a
population decline as a result of radiation damage to eggs.

In sum, the speaker's argument depends on a series of doubtful assumptions, and is
therefore weak. To strengthen it the speaker must supply better evidence that the total
salamander population is declining, and must rule out all other possible explanations for that
decline. The speaker must also provide clear evidence that the current level of radiation
reaching the surface is as potentially damaging to the eggs of other species, and must account
for why other species have not already experienced a declining population. Finally, to better
assess the argument I would need a reliable prognosis for the Earth's ozone layer.
