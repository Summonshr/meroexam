Argument 62
---------------------------

*The following recommendation was made by the president and administrative staff of Grove
College, a private institution, to the college's governing committee.*

**We recommend that Grove College preserve its century-old tradition of all-female education
rather than admit men into its programs. It is true that a majority of faculty members voted in
favor of coeducation, arguing that it would encourage more students to apply to Grove. But
eighty percent of the students responding to a survey conducted by the student government
wanted the school to remain all female, and over half of the alumni who answered a separate
survey also opposed coeducation. Keeping the college all-female, therefore, will improve
morale among students and convince alumni to keep supporting the college financially.**


In this memo Grove College's administration recommends preserving its tradition of
admitting only female students. The administration admits that most faculty members are in
favor of a co-educational policy as a means of encouraging more students to apply to Grove.

But the administration defends its recommendation by citing a student government survey in
which 80% of student respondents and more than 50% of alumni respondents reported that
they favor the status quo. The administration reasons that preserving the status quo would
improve student morale and help ensure continued alumni donations to Grove. This argument
is flawed in several critical respects.

First, the memo provides no evidence that the results of either of the two surveys are
statistically reliable. For example, suppose newer students tend to be content with the all
female policy while students who have attended Grove for a longer time would prefer a
co-educational policy. If a disproportionate number of the survey's respondents were newer
students, then the survey results would distort the student body's opinion as a group. With
respect to the alumni survey, perhaps fewer alumni who donate substantial sums to Grove
responded to the survey than other alumni did. If so, then the survey results would distort the
comparison between the total amount of future donations under the two scenarios. Besides,
the memo provides no information about what percentage of Grove's students and alumni
responded to the surveys; the lower the percentages, the less reliable the results of the
surveys.

Secondly, the administration hastily assumes that Grove's alumni as a group would be less
inclined to donate money merely if Grove begins admitting male students. This aspect of
Grove's admission policy is only one of many factors that might affect alumni donations. For
example, since Grove's faculty are generally in favor of changing the policy, perhaps the
change would improve faculty morale and therefore the quality of instruction, in mm having a
positive impact on alumni donations. And, if the particular alumni who are in a position to make
the largest contributions recognize faculty morale as important, an increase in donations by
these individuals might very well offset a dedine in smaller donations by other alumni.

Finally, the administration's argument that student morale would improve under the status
quo is logically unsound in two respects. First, the administration provides no reason why
morale would improve, as opposed to remaining at its current level, if the status quo is simply
maintained. Second, the administration cannot logically determine how the morale of the
student body would be affected under a co-educational policy until it implements that policy
and takes into account the morale of the new male students along with that of all female
students.

In sum, the administration has failed to convince me that maintaining Grove's all-female
policy would be more likely to improve student morale and help ensure continued alumni
donations than moving to a co-educational policy. To better assess the argument I would need
detailed information about the two surveys to determine whether the respondents as groups
were representative of their respective populations. To bolster its recommendation the
administration must provide better evidence--perhaps by way of a reliable alumni survey that
takes into account respondents' financial status and history of donadons--that prospective
donor alumni would be strongly opposed to a co-educational policy and would be less inclined
to donate money were Grove to implement such a policy.
