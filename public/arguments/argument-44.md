Argument 44
---------------------------

*The following is taken from an advertisement placed in a weekly business magazine by the
Dickens Academy.*

**We distributed a survey to senior management at International Mega-Publishing, Inc. The
result of the survey clearly indicates that many employees were well prepared in business
knowledge and computer skills, but lacked interpersonal skills to interact gracefully with
customers. International Mega-Publishing decided to improve customer satisfaction by
sending their newly hired employees to our one-day seminars. Since taking advantage of our
program, International Mega-Publishing has seen a sharp increase in sales, an indication that
the number of their disgruntled customers has declined significantly. Your company should hire
Dickens and let us turn every employee into an ambassador for your company.**


This Dickens Academy ad claims that any company wanting to improve customer relations
will benefit from enrolling its employees in Dickens' one-day seminars. To support this claim
the ad cites Mega-Publishing's improved sales after its new employees attended Dickens'
seminar as an indication of improved customer relations. As it stands the ad rests on a series
of dubious assumptions, and is therefore unconvincing.

In the first place, the ad relies on the unsubstantiated assumption that the Mega employees
attending the seminar are positioned to influence Mega's sales and its customer relations.

Perhaps these new employees were hired for production, editorial, or personnel positions that
have nothing to do with customer relations and that have only an indirect and negligible impact
on sales. Without providing evidence that these new employees directly influence Mega's
customer relations and sales, I cannot accept the argument that the Dickens seminar was
responsible for any of Mega's sales or customer-relations improvements subsequent to the
seminar.

Even if Mega's seminar attendees are involved in sales and customer relations, the ad
unfairly assumes that the improvement in Mega's sales must be attributable to the seminar.

Perhaps the improvement in sales was the result of increasing product demand, new pricing
policies, decreased competition, or any one of a myriad of other possible developments. For
that matter, perhaps Mega's new employees as a group already possessed exceptional
interpersonal skills, and therefore Mega's sales and customer relations would have improved
during the ensuing months regardless of the seminar. Since the ad fails to consider and rule
out these and other alternative explanations for the improvements at Mega, I find the ad's daim
that the Dickens seminar should receive credit unconvincing.

Even if the Dickens seminar was responsible for improved sales and customer relations at
Mega, the ad's claim that all other businesses would benefit similarly from a Dickens seminar
is unjustified. It is entirely possible that the techniques and skills that participants in Dickens'
seminars learn are effective for the kind of business in which Mega engages, but not for other
types of businesses. Although it is possible that Dickens' training methods would be equally
effective for other types of businesses, since Dickens has not provided evidence that this is the
case I remain unconvinced by the ad's daim.

In sum, this ad fails to provide key evidence needed to support its claim. To strengthen that
claim Dickens must show that Mega’s seminar attendees – and not other employees or other
occurrences – were indeed responsible for the subsequent improvement in sales, and that
customer relations also improved as a result of their attending the seminar. Dikens must also
provide additional success stories – about other types of businesses – to convince me
Dickens’ traning methods will work for any business.
