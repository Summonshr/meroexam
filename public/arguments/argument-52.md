Argument 52
---------------------------

**Claitown University needs both affordable housing for its students and a way to fund the
building of such housing. The best solution to this problem is to commission a famous architect
known for experimental and futuristic buildings. It is common knowledge that tourists are
willing to pay money to tour some of the architect's buildings, so it can be expected that
tourists will want to visit this new building. The income from the fees charged to tourists will
soon cover the building costs. Furthermore, such a building will attract new students as well as
donations from alumni. And even though such a building will be much larger than our current
need for student housing, part of the building can be used as office space.**

This argument recommends commissioning a famous architect known for futuristic and
experimental designs as the best means of providing new affordable housing for Claitown
University students. The argument's line of reasoning is that the building will attract paying
tourists, new students, and donations from alumni all of which will help raise the funds
needed for the project. However, the argument is problematic in several critical respects.

First of all, a famous architect might charge a substantial fee for the project, in which case
the funds raised by charging tourists and through alumni donations might be offset to the point
of rendering the entire project unfeasible financially. The argument's proponent must address
this issue before I can accept the argument's conclusion.

Secondly, the argument relies on the tenuous assumption that tourists will be interested in
paying for tours of a building used for a purpose as mundane as student housing. It is entirely
possible that once the building is in use, tourists will not be willing to pay for tours. Besides,
perhaps the appeal of this architect's buildings lies primarily in their exteriors, in which case
tourists would be able to appreciate the new building's salient architectural features without
paying for a tour. In either case, the argument's claim that the architect's notoriety and the
building itself will generate the funds needed for its construction would be dubious at best.

Thirdly, the argument fails to explain how the University will be able to pay for construction
when it will not begin to receive the revenue it needs until after construction is complete.

Unless the architect and contractors agree to be paid later, the argument's proponent cannot
convince me that the recommended course of action will achieve the University's goals.

Finally, the argument assumes without justification that a futuristic or experimental building
will attract alumni donations and students. While this might be true, it is also possible that
instead the University's alumni and students stronger prefer the architectural status quo at
their campus; in fact, the appeal of the campus' predominant architectural styles might be one
of the key attractions for students and alumni dollars. Thus I would need some evidence to
substantiate this assumption before I can accept the argument's conclusion.

In sum, as it stands the argument is not well supported. To strengthen it, the argument's
proponent must supply dear evidence--perhaps involving other college buildings designed by
famous architects--that tourists will be willing to pay for tours of the building once it is
completed and is in use as student housing. To better assess the argument I would need
detailed and realistic financial projections, accounting for the architect's fees, to determine the
project's financial feasibility. I would also need to know--perhaps by way of a reliable
survey--the extent to which students and alumni would be likely to support the project.
