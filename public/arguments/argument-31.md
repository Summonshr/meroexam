Argument 31
---------------------------

**Your recent article on corporate downsizing in the United States is misleading. The article
gives the mistaken impression that many competent workers who lost jobs as a result of
downsizing face serious economic hardship, often for years, before finding other suitable
employment. But this impression is contradicted by a recent report on the United States
economy, which found that since 1992 far more jobs have been created than have been
eliminated. The report also demonstrates that many of those who lost their jobs have found
new employment. Two-thirds of the newly created jobs have been in industries that tend to pay
above-average wages, and the vast majority of these jobs are full-time.**


Downsizing is the process in which corporations deliberately reduce the number of their
employees.

This editorial disagrees with a certain article's claim that as a result of widespread corporate
downsizing many able workers have faced serious long-term economic hardship--due to their
inability to find other suitable employment. To justify its disagreement with this daim the
editorial cites the following three findings of a recent report:
* There has been a net increase
in the number of new jobs created since 1992,
* many workers who lost their jobs have found
other work, and
* most newly created jobs are full-time positions in industries which tend to
pay above-average wages. Careful scrutiny of these findings, however, reveals that they
accomplish little toward refuting the article's claim.

Regarding the fu:st finding, the editorial overlooks the possibility that most of the newly
created jobs since 1992 are not suitable for job-seekers downsized by corporations. Perhaps
the vast majority of these jobs involve food serving, clerical assistance, deanmg and
maintenance, and other tasks requiring a low level of skill and experience. At the same 6me,
perhaps most downsized job-seekers are highly educated middle-managers looking for the
same type of work elsewhere. In short, lacking evidence that the newly created jobs match the
skills, experience, and interests of the downsized corporate employees, the editorial's author
cannot convincingly refute the article's claim.

As for the second finding, the term **many** is far too vague to allow for any meaningful
conclusions; if **many** amounts to an insignificant percentage of downsized employees, then
the finding is of little use in refuting the article's claim. Moreover, the workers to whom this
finding refers are not necessarily downsized corporate employees. To the extent that they are
not, this second finding is irrelevant in drawing any conclusions about the impact of corporate
downsizing on downsized employees.

The third finding would lend support to the author's position only under two assumptions:
* that the newly created jobs in those high-paying industries are suitable for downsized
corporate employees, and
* that the new jobs are among the high-paying ones. Otherwise,
downsized employees seeking jobs would be unlikely to regain their former economic status
by applying for these newly created positions, whether or not these positions are full-time.

In sum, the author has not effectively refuted the article's claim that corporate downsizing
has worked economic hardship on downsized corporate employees. To more effectively refute
the claim the author should provide clear evidence that most of those job-seekers are able to
fill the sorts of new jobs that have been created since 1992, and that these new positions are
suitable for those job-seekers given their work experience, areas of interest, and former
salaries.
