Argument 76
---------------------------

**A new report suggests that men and women experience pain very differently from one another,
and that doctors should consider these differences when prescribing pain medications. When
researchers administered the same dosage of kappa options--- a painkiller---to 28 men and 20
women who were having their wisdom teeth extracted, the women reported feeling much less
pain than the men, and the easing of pain lasted considerably longer in women. This research
suggests that kappa opioids should be prescribed for women whenever pain medication is
required, whereas men should be given other kinds of pain medication. In addition,
researchers should reevaluate the effects of all medications on men versus women.**

This argument condudes that the pain medication kappa opioids (KO) should be prescribed
for women but not for men. To support this condusion the speaker cites a recent study
involving 28 men and 20 women who took KO when having wisdom teeth removed; according
to these patients' reports, the women felt less pain than the men, and for the women the easing
of pain lasted longer. The argument is flawed in several important respects.

One problem with the argument is that since the study involved only 48 people it is
impossible to confidently draw any conclusions about the general population from it.

Specifically, the argument overlooks other possible reasons why these particular women
reported less pain than the men did. The women in the study might have a
higher-than-average pain threshold; conversely, the men in the study might have a
lower-than-average pain threshold. Or perhaps this group of women are less prone to
complain about pain than this group of men---due to their unusually stoical nature or their
experience with painful medical procedures.

Another problem with the argument is that it overlooks other factors that might have
contributed to the amount of pain these patients experienced. Perhaps the women's wisdom
teeth were not as impacted as the men's teeth generally, so that for the women the surgery
was not as invasive and painful. Perhaps some of the women took other medications as well to
help relieve the pain. For that matter, some of the men might have taken certain foods or
medications that counteracted the effects of KO. In short, unless the experiment was
conducted in a controlled environment in which all factors were the same for the men as for the
women, it is impossible to draw any firm conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of
KO for the two sexes.

Even if KO is more effective for women than for men, the argument's conclusion that men
should take another pain medication instead is unwarranted. It is entirely possible that KO is
still the most effective pain medication for men. Without comparing the effectiveness of KO to
that of other pain medications, the speaker simply cannot justify his recommendation that men
avoid KO.

In sum, the argument has not convinced me that men should take a medication other than
KO for pain. To strengthen the argument the speaker must assure me that the men and
women in the study are representative of men and women generally--in terms of their dental
profile, experience in handling pain, and willingness to recognize and report pain. The speaker
must also assure me that the study was performed in a controlled environment where all other
factors possibly affecting pain remained constant. To better assess the argument I would need
to know how effective KO is compared to other medications in reducing pain for men.
