Argument 67
---------------------------

*The following is a memorandum written by the director of personnel to the president of the
Cedar Corporation.*

**It would be a mistake to rehire the Good-Taste Company to supply the food in our employee
cafeteria next year. It is the second most expensive caterer in the city. In addition, its prices
have risen in each of the last three years, and it refuses to provide meals for people on special
diets. Just last month three employees complained to me that they no longer eat in the
cafeteria because they find the experience 'unbearable.' Our company should instead hire
Discount Foods. Discount is a family-owned local company and it offers a varied menu of fish
and poultry. I recently tasted a sample lunch at one of the many companies that Discount
serves and it was delicious---an indication that hiring Discount will lead to improved employee
satisfaction.**


This memo recommends that Cedar Corporation replace its current food provider,
Good-Taste, with Discount Foods. To support this recommendation, the memo's author cites
Good-Taste's increasing fees, the fact that three Cedar employees refuse to eat in the
cafeteria, and various features of Discount Foods. For several reasons, this evidence fails to
provide adequate support for the recommendation.

The memo's reliance on the fact that three Cedar employees find eating in the company
cafeteria **unbearable** presents two problems. First, the memo unfairly assumes that
Good-Taste is responsible for these complaints. It is entirely possible that other conditions in
the cafeteria are instead responsible. Second, the memo assumes that complaints by only
three Cedar employees constitutes a statistically significant number which warrants replacing
Good-Taste with another food provider. However, the memo provides no evidence that this is
the case.

Another problem with the recommendation is that it relies partly on the fact that Good Taste
has been increasing its fees and is now the second-most-expensive food provider available to
Cedar. Yet the recommendation is based on what food provider would best satisfy Cedar's
employees, not what provider would reduce Cedar's costs. In other words, this evidence is not
directly relevant to the reasons for the author's recommendation. Even if expense were a
legitimate factor, it is possible that Discount is even more expensive than Good-Taste.

Yet another problem with the recommendation is that it relies partly on the need to
accommodate employees with special dietary needs. The memo provides no evidence that
Good-Taste is any less capable than Discount of accommodating these employees. Rather,
the memo merely provides that Discount offers **a varied menu of fish and poultry.** Without a
more detailed comparison between the offerings of the two compapies, it is unfair to conclude
that one would meet the needs of Cedar's employees better than the other would.

Finally, the recommendation relies partly on the fact that in one taste test the memo's author
found Discount Foods to be **delicious.** In all likelihood, however, the author's tastes do not
represent the collective tastes of Cedar employees; accordingly, the author's report is patently
insufficient to demonstrate that Cedar's employees would be more satisfied with Discount than
with Good-Taste.

In conclusion, the letter's author fails to adequately support the recommendation that Cedar
replace Good-Taste with Discount. To strengthen the argument, the author must provide clear
evidence that Cedar employees are dissatisfied with Good-Taste's food, and that they would
be more satisfied with Discount's food. To better evaluate the argument, we would need more
information comparing the two companies' menus to determine which is more varied and
caters to those with special dietary needs.
