Argument 108
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a corporate planning memo at ABC Cereal Company, the makers of
Better Bran cereal.*

**Sales of Better Bran have declined in recent years, for reasons that management has now
identified. First, Better Bran is a cereal with high sugar content, and recent research studies
have found that most consumers say they are concerned about the amount of sugar added to
their breakfast cereal. Second, the price of Better Bran has increased by 5% in each of the last
three years. Therefore, to increase our company's profits we need to reduce the amount of
sugar in Better Bran and lower Better Bran's price.**


This ABC Cereal Company memo concludes that to increase its profitability ABC must lower
both the sugar content and price of its Better Bran (BB) cereal. To justify this conclusion the
memo cites the fact that sales of BB have declined in recent years. The memo attributes this
decline to a concern among most consumers about the amount of sugar in their cereals, and to
the 5% increase in the price of BB during each of the last three years. The memo is
unconvincing for several reasons.

First, the mere fact that most consumers are concerned about sugar in cereal amounts to
scant evidence that the decline in BB sales is due to that concern. The level of concern, or the
amount of sugar in BB, might not be sufficiently high to cause consumers to stop buying BB
cereal on either basis. Moreover, unless the level of concern has grown during recent years I
cannot take seriously the claim that declining BB sales in recent years is due to that
concern--rather than to some other event or trend.

Secondly, assuming that the 5% price increases have contributed to the decline in BB sales,
it would be premature to conclude that profits from BB sales have also declined as a result.

Perhaps the additional revenue from the price increases more than offset the decline in
revenue due to the diminishing number of units sold. Thus ABC cannot convince me on the
basis of the price increases and the sales decline that lowering BB's price would serve to
improve ABC's overall profitability.

Thirdly, the memo's recommendation rests on the dubious assumption that the proposed
actions are the only two means of increasing ABC's overall profitability. In all likelihood, ABC's
profits are a function not only of how many boxes of BB it sells but also of its costs and its
revenue from other products. Perhaps ABC can improve its profits by other means--such as
expanding its cereal Line, marketing BB to health-conscious consumers and raising the price
of BB, or cutting costs in other areas. For that matter, if other cereal companies raise their
prices, consumers might begin to consider BB a bargain at its current price--or perhaps even
at a somewhat higher price. In short, since the memo has not ruled out all other possible
scenarios that might serve to improve ABC's overall profitability I simply cannot take the
memo's recommendation seriously.

Finally, even in the unlikely event that one of the two proposed changes is necessary to
increase ABC's overall profitability, the memo's assertion that both changes are necessary
might nevertheless be unwarranted. Perhaps only one of the two changes will suffice. Since
the memo ignores this possibility the strength of its recommendation remains questionable at
best.

In sum, ABC might be ill-advised to follow the memo's advice. To strengthen the argument
that ABC must lower BB's price and sugar content to improve profitability, ABC's planners must
provide clear evidence that consumer concern about sugar in cereals is the primary reason for
declining BB sales, and that this decline has diminished BB's profitability. To better assess
ABC's claim that the proposed course of action is necessary to improve ABC's profitability, I
would need to know what other alternatives, if any, are available to ABC for cutting costs and
for increasing revenue.
