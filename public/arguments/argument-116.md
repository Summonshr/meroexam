Argument 116
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memo from the vice president of a company that builds shopping
malls throughout the country.*

**The surface of a section of Route 101, paved two years ago by McAdam Road Builders, is
now badly cracked and marred by dangerous potholes. In another part of the state, a section
of Route 66, paved by Appian Roadways more than four years ago, is still in good condition.

Appian Roadways has recently purchased state-of-the-art paving machinery, and it has hired a
new quality-control manager. Because of its superior work and commitment to quality, we
should contract with Appian Roadways rather than McAdam Road Builders to construct the
access roads for all our new shopping malls.**


The vice president of a company that builds shopping malls argues here that the company
should hire Appian rather than McAdam to build access roads for the company. To support this
argument the vice president points out that a certain area of Route 101 that McAdam repaved
two years ago has deteriorated significantly, while a certain stretch of Route 66 that Appian
repaved four years ago remains in good condition. The vice president also points out that
Appian recently acquired new state-of-the-art paving equipment and hired a new
quality-control manager. I find the vice president's argument logically unconvincing--in several
respects.

First of all, it is unfair to infer based solely on the comparison between the two stretches of
highway that Appian does better work than McAdam. The inference relies on the poor
assumption that the comparative qnality of two contractors' work, rather than some other
phenomenon, was responsible for the comparative condition of the two stretches of pavement.

Perhaps the stretch that McAdam repaved is located in an area whose extremes in climate or
high traffic volume serve to erode and damage pavement very quickly. For that matter, perhaps
soil or other geological conditions in that area were primarily responsible for deterioration of
the pavement along that stretch. In short, without showing that all other conditions in the two
areas have been essentially the same, the vice president cannot convince me that the quality
of McAdam's and Appian's repaying work was responsible for the difference in how well the
two stretches of pavement have held up.

Secondly, it is unfair to conclude based on Appian's recent equipment acquisition and
personnel decision that Appian will do a better job than McAdam. Perhaps McAdam has also
acquired the same type of equipment. Moreover, perhaps McAdam's quality-control manager
is far more experienced than Appian's new manager, and as a result McAdam's product is
likely to be better than Appian's. Besides, equipment and on-site management are only two of
many factors affecting the quality of a pavement job. Other such factors include the experience
and competence of other workers, and the paving material used. Without showing that the two
firms are similar in these and other respects, the vice president cannot justify his
recommendation of Appian over McAdam.

Finally, the vice president's recommendation rests on the unlikely assumption that the
company has only two altematives--McAdam and Appian. In all likelihood the company can
engage one of many other paving contractors instead. Thus to the extent the vice president
recommends Appian over not just McAdam but over any other contractor the recommendation
is unwarranted.

In sum, the vice president has not convinced me that the company should hire Appian. To
strengthen the argument the vice president must provide dear evidence that it was the quality
of McAdam's and Appian's work rather than one or more other factors--that resulted in the
difference between how well the two stretches of pavement have held up over time. The vice
president must also provide better evidence that Appian's new equipment and new manager
will enhance, or at least maintain, the quality of Appian's overall work at a higher level than
McAdam's overall work. Finally, to better assess the argument I would need to know what
other paving contractors the company could hire, and the quality of those contractors' work
compared to McAdam's and Appian's.
