Argument 85
---------------------------

**Statistics collected from dentists indicate that three times more men than women faint while
visiting the dentist. This evidence suggests that men are more likely to be distressed about
having dental work done than women are. Thus, dentists who advertise to attract patients
should target the male consumer and emphasize both the effectiveness of their anesthetic
techniques and the sensitivity of their staff to nervous or suffering patients.**

This argument contends that dentists' advertisements should target male patients, and
should focus on assuaging distress about the pain associated with dental work. To support this
assertion the argument cites statistics showing that three times more men than women faint
while visiting dentists. The argument suffers from several logical problems, and is therefore
unpersuasive.

To begin with, the argument depends on the assumption that men who faint while visiting the
dentist do so because they are distressed about the sorts of factors that the proposed
advertising aims to address. Yet the argument provides no evidence clearly estabfishing this
causal relationship. It is equally likely that other factors are instead responsible for the fact that
more men than women faint at the dentist's office. Perhaps on average men suffer from more
painful dental problems than women, explaining why more men than women faint at dental
offices. Without ruling out this and other altemative explanations, the speaker cannot convince
me that any advertising technique will reduce either distress or fainting among male patients.

Another problem with the argument is that the speaker provides no evidence that the
proposed advertising techniques will have the intended effect. Perhaps fewer men than
women notice dental advertisements. Or perhaps the proposed advertising techniques will
have the opposite effect--by calling attention to the very sorts of images that cause distress
and fainting. The speaker must address these possibilities and rule them out before we can
accept the recommendation.

Finally, the speaker's recommendation relies on two unsubstantiated assumptions about the
statistics that the speaker cites. The first is that the patients contributing to these statistics are
representative of all dental patients. It is entirely possible, for instance, that a disproportionate
number of male patients contributed to the statistics, rendering them biased and therefore
unreliable. The second unsubstantiated assumption is that the number of patients contributing
to these statistics is large enough to be statistically significant. Unless the speaker can
substantiate this assumption, he cannot justifiably rely on these statistics to draw any general
inferences about dental patients.

In conclusion, the argument cannot be taken seriously as it stands. To strengthen it, the
speaker must show why men become distressed and faint during visits to their dentists, and
that the proposed advertising techniques would in fact achieve their intended result. To better
evaluate the argument we would need more information about the statistics that the argument
cites--specifically, how many patients contributed to these statistics and whether these patients
are representative of dental patients in general.
