Argument 66
---------------------------

*The following appeared in the annual report from the president of the National Brush
Company.*

**In order to save money, we at the National Brush Company have decided to pay our
employees for each brush they produce instead of for the time they spend producing brushes.

We believe that this policy will lead to the production of more and better brushes, will allow us
to reduce our staff size, and will enable the company factories to operate for fewer
hours---resulting in savings on electricity and security costs. These changes will ensure that
the best workers keep their jobs and that the company will earn a profit in the coming year.**


In this report, the president of National Brush Company (NBC) concludes that the best way
to ensure that NBC will earn a profit next year is for the company to pay its workers according
to the number of brushes they produce--rather than hourly. To support this conclusion, the
president claims that the new policy will result in the production of more and better brushes,
which in turn will allow NBC to reduce its staff size and operating hours, thereby cutting
expenses. This argument is fraught with dubious assumptions, which render it entirely
unconvincing.

First of all, the argument relies on the unsubstantiated assumption that the new policy will
motivate workers to produce brushes more quickly. Whether this is the case will depend, of
course, on the amount earned per brush and the rate at which workers can produce brushes. It
will also depend on the extent to which NBC workers are content with their current income
level. Lacking evidence that the new policy would result in the production of more brushes, the
president cannot convince me that this policy would be an effective means to ensure a profit
for NBC in the coming year.

Even if the new policy does motivate NBC workers to produce more brushes, the president's
argument depends on the additional assumption that producing brushes more quickly can be
accomplished without sacrificing quality. In fact, the president goes further by predicting an
increase in quality. Yet common sense informs me that, if the production process otherwise
remains the same, quicker production is likely to reduce quality--and in any event certainly not
increase it. And a decline in quality might serve to diminish the value of NBC's brushes in the
marketplace. Thus the ultimate result of the new policy might be to reduce NBC's revenue and,
in mm, profits.

Even assuming that as the result of the new policy NBC's current work force produces more
brushes without sacrificing quality, reducing the size of the work force and the number of
operating hours would serve to offset those production gains. Admittedly, by keeping the most
efficient employees NBC would minimize the extent of this offset. Nevertheless, the president
provides no evidence that the result would be a net gain in production. Without any such
evidence the president's argument that the new policy will help ensure profitability is highly
suspect.

In sum, the president has failed to provide adequate evidence to support his claim that the
new policy would serve to ensure a profit for NBC in the coming year. To strengthen the
argument, NBC should conduct a survey or other study to demonstrate not only its workers'
willingness to work more quickly but also their ability to maintain quality at a quicker pace. To
better assess the argument I would need detailed financial projections comparing current
payroll and other operating costs with projected costs under the new policy--in order to
determine whether NBC is likely to be more profitable under the proposed scheme.
