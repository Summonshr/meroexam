Argument 21
---------------------------

**A recent sales study indicated that consumption of seafood dishes in Bay City restaurants has
increased by 30 percent over the past five years. Yet there are no currently operating city
restaurants that specialize in seafood. Moreover, the majority of families in Bay City are
two-income families, and a nationwide study has shown that such families eat significantly
fewer home-cooked meals than they did a decade ago but at the same time express more
concern about eating healthily. Therefore, a new Bay City restaurant specializing in seafood
will be quite popular and profitable.**

This argument's conclusion is that a new Bay City restaurant specializing in seafood would
be both popular and profitable. To justify this conclusion the argument points out that seafood
consumption in Bay City's restaurants has risen by 30% during the last five years. Also, the
argument points out that most Bay City families are two-income families, and cites a national
survey showing that two-income families eat out more often and express more concern about
eating healthily than they did ten years ago. I find the argument unpersuasive, for several
reasons.

First, a 30% increase in seafood consumption at Bay City restaurants does not necessarily
indicate a sufficient demand for a new Bay City restaurant serving seafood dishes only.

Although a 30% increase seems significant, the actual level of consumption might
nevertheless be very low. This scenario is quite possible, especially considering that there are
currently no seafood restaurants in Bay City. Lacking evidence that a significant number of the
city's restaurant patrons are ordering seafood, the argument's conclusion that a new seafood
restaurant would be popular and profitable is unjustified.

Secondly, even if current demand would otherwise support an increase in the availability of
seafood at Bay City's restaurants, the argument unfairly assumes that Bay City's restaurant
patrons who order seafood would frequent the new restaurant. Perhaps the vast majority of
these patrons would remain loyal to their favorite restaurant. Thus lacking evidence that these
patrons would be willing to try the new restaurant the argument's claim that a new seafood
restaurant would be popular is dubious.

Thirdly, the nationwide study showing clear trends among two-income families toward dining
out and eating healthily does not necessarily apply to Bay City. It is quite possible that Bay
City's two-income families do not follow these general trends. For that matter, in Bay City the
trend might be just the opposite. Thus the nationwide trends that the argument cites amount to
scant evidence that Bay City residents in particular would frequent a new seafood restaurant in
their city.

Fourth, even if most of Bay City's families are following the nationwide trends indicated
above, it is unreasonable to infer that these famih'es will necessarily patronize a new seafood
restaurant in Bay City. For all we know Bay City might boast a variety of health-oriented
restaurants that do not specialize in seafood. For that matter, perhaps Bay City's existing
restaurants are responding to the trends by providing more healthful dishes. Moreover,
perhaps either or both of these trends will soon reverse themselves--at least in Bay City--for
whatever reason. Any of these scenarios, if true, would cast considerable doubt on the
argument's conclusion that a new seafood restaurant in Bay City would be popular and
profitable.

Finally, even if Bay City families flock to the new seafood restaurant, the restaurant would
not necessarily be profitable as a result. Profitability is a function of both revenue and expense.

Thus it is entirely possible that the restaurant's costs of obtaining high-quality, healthful
seafood, or of promoting the new restaurant, might render it unprofitable despite its popularity.

Without weighing revenue against expenses the argument's conclusion is premature at best.

In sum, the argument is unpersuasive as it stands. To bolster it the argument's author must
show--perhaps by way of a reliable citywide study--that the demand among restaurant patrons
for seafood is sufficient to support a new seafood restaurant, and that a sufficient number of
people who order fish at Bay City restaurants will be able and willing to at least try the new
restaurant. The author would also bolster the argument by providing reliable evidence that Bay
City reflects the nationwide trends cited, and that these trends will continue in the foreseeable
future in Bay City. Finally, to better assess the argument I would need detailed cost and
revenue estimates for a new Bay City seafood restaurant--to determine the likelihood that
even a popular such restaurant would turn a profit.
