Argument 78
---------------------------

*The following is a letter to the editor of the Glenville Gazette, a local newspaper.*

**Over the past few years, the number of people who have purchased advance tickets for the
Glenville Summer Concert series has declined, indicating lack of community support. Although
the weather has been unpredictable in the past few years, this cannot be the reason for the
decline in advance ticket purchases, because many people attended the concerts even in bad
weather. Clearly, then, the reason for the decline is the choice of music, so the organizers of
the concert should feature more modern music in the future and should be sure to include
music composed by Richerts, whose recordings Glenville residents purchase more often than
any other contemporary recordings. This strategy will undoubtedly increase advance ticket
purchases and will increase attendance at the concerts.**


This letter recommends that Glenville feature modern music, especially the music of
Richerts, at its summer concerts in order to boost advance ticket sales and attendance. To
support this recommendation the letter's author points out that advance-ticket sales have
declined over the past few years, but that unpredictable weather cannot be the reason for the
decline because **many people attended the concerts even in bad weather.** The author
concludes that choice of music must be the reason for the decline, then reasons further that
since Richerts' recordings are very popular among Glenville residents featuring Richerts'
music at the concerts would boost ticket sales and attendance. I find this argument to be
logically unconvincing in several respects.

As a threshold matter, the author unfairly equates the number of ticket purchasers with the
number of tickets purchased. The author ignores the possibility that the average number of
tickets sold to each purchaser is increasing and, as a result, the total number of tickets is not
declining--or perhaps even increasing. Thus the author cannot convincingly conclude that
Glenville has a ticket-sale problem in the first place.

Even if the actual number of tickets sold in advance has been declining, the author
condudes too hastily that unpredictable weather cannot be the reason for the decline. Perhaps
concert attendees during the past few years have now learned from their experience with bad
concert weather not to purchase advance tickets again. Besides, the mere fact that **many
people** attended concerts in bad weather proves nothing unless the author can show that total
attendance has been lower in bad weather than in good weather.

Even assuming unpredictable weather is not the reason for the decline in advance ticket
sales, the author falsely assumes that the decline must be attributable to choice of music. This
**either-or** argument is fallacious in that it ignores other possible causes of the decline. For
example, perhaps during the last few years Glenville has begun its promotional efforts
unusually late. Or perhaps the number of oudets where tickets are available in advance has
declined. For that matter, perhaps Glenville's demographics are in flux so that the total number
of residents willing and able to attend summer concerts is declining.

Finally, even assuming that choice of music is the true cause of the decline in advance ticket
sales, the author fails to provide adequate evidence that choosing modern music, and
Richerts' compositions in particular, will boost sales and attendance. The author unfairly
assumes that people who purchase recordings are the same group that would be inclined to
attend live concerts. Lacking evidence that this is the case, the author cannot convince me that
the proposed course of action will bring about its intended result.

In sum, the argument is logically unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the author must
fzrst establish a dear causal relationship between the number of people buying advance
tickets and actual concert attendance. The author must also provide evidence--perhaps by
way of a reliable survey--that the **many people** who have attended the concerts in bad
weather are likely to do so again despite their experience. The author must then consider and
eliminate all other possible explanations for the decline. Finally, to better assess the argument
I would need more information about the musical tastes of the Glenville residents who are
most inclined to attend live concerts.
