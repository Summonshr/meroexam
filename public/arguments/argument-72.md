Argument 72
---------------------------

**In the Bayhead Public Library, books that are rarely borrowed continue to take up shelf space
year after year, while people who want to read a recent novel frequently find that the library's
only copy is checked out. Clearly, the library's plan to replace books that are borrowed no more
than once a year with sufficient copies of more recent books will solve this problem. The
protest we have heard since this plan was made public has come from a small, and thus
unrepresentative, group of some thirty people and so should therefore be ignored.**

In this argument the speaker supports Bayhead Public Library's plan to replace books that are
borrowed less frequently than once per year with additional copies of recent novels. In support
of this position, the speaker suggests that seldom-borrowed books amount to wasted shelf
space because people who want to read recent novels frequently find the library's only copy
checked out. In further support of this position, the speaker points out that only thirty people
have protested the plan. I find the speaker's position unjustified in several critical respects.

First of all, the speaker ignores the possibility that replacing less popular books with more
copies of popular new novels will undermine the library's primary function as a repository of a
wide variety of books for free public access. New books are available at bookstores, whereas
older, less popular ones are not. Thus the library might lose the patronage of a large
percentage of the community should it adopt the plan.

Secondly, the speaker unfairly implies that the library has only two options: to maintain the
status quo or to follow the proposed plan. Some other alternative---one that wou,Ud appease
protesters while preserving community support--might provide an optimal long-term solution.

For example, perhaps the library can remove books that have not been borrowed for three
years or for five years, rather than for one year. Although this alternate plan would free up less
shelf space than the current plan, it would nevertheless make room for the most popular new
books.

Finally, the mere fact that only thirty people have protested the plan accomplishes litde
toward supporting the speaker's argument--for two reasons. First, this statistic is scant
evidence that the community at large would support the plan; it is entirely possible that many
opponents have simply not voiced their opposition. Second, the thirty protesters might very
well be in a position to influence many other people; or they might be among the library's most
significant financial patrons. In either event, ignoring these protesters might result in the
ultimate loss of community or financial support the library needs to thrive, or even survive.

In sum, the library's plan seems neither well-reasoned nor well-supported. To strengthen her
position, the speaker must convince me that the plan is the only viable option to maintaining
the status quo. To better assess the plan's impact on the library's value as a community
resource, I would need to know what percentage of the library's current inventory would be
replaced under the plan. I would also need to know the extent of influence among the thirty
protesters, and the extent of support for the plan among the vast majority of community
members who have not voiced their opinions about it.
