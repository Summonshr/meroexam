Argument 6
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Clearview newspaper.*

**In the next mayoral election, residents of Clearview should vote for Ann Green, who is a
member of the Good Earth Coalition, rather than for Frank Braun, a member of the Clearview
town council, because the current members are not protecting our environment. For example,
during the past year the number of factories in Clearview has doubled, air pollution levels have
increased, and the local hospital has treated 25 percent more patients with respiratory
illnesses. If we elect Ann Green, the environmental problems in Clearview will certainly be
solved.**


This editorial recommends that Clearview residents vote to replace city-council member
Frank Braun with Ann Green, a member of the Good Earth Coalition. To support this
recommendation the editorial cites a significant increase during the last year in the number of
Clearview factories and in the number of Clearview hospital patients treated for respiratory
illnesses. On the basis of this evidence the author infers that the current council members are
not protecting the city's environment and that electing Green will solve the city's environmental
problems. This argument is logically flawed in several critical respects.

To begin with, the argument unfairly assumes that last year's increase in the number of
factories was due to the city council's decisions--rather than to some other phenomenon-and
that this increase poses environmental problems for Clearview. The editorial provides no
evidence to substantiate these assumptions. Lacking such evidence it is entirely possible that
the council actually opposed the increase but lacked adequate authority to prevent it, or that
the new factories do not in fact harm Clearview's environment.

The argument also assumes unfairly that last year's increase in the number of patients
reporting respiratory problems indicates worsening environmental problems in Clear view.

Perhaps the actual incidence of such health problems has not increased, and the reported
increase is due to increasing awareness among Clearview residents of respiratory problems.

Even if the incidence of respiratory problems has in fact increased, the increase might due to
an influx of people with pre-existing such problems, or to more effective cigarette marketing.

Since the editorial fails to rule out these and other possible explanations for the increase, I
cannot accept any conclusions about Clearview's environment let alone about who voters
should elect to city council based on last year's hospital records.

Even if the two cited increases do indicate a worsening of Clearview's environment due to
the city council's decisions, the argument rests on the further assumption that Braun was a
factor in those decisions. But, since the editorial provides no evidence to substantiate this
assumption it is equally possible that Braun actually opposed the decisions that were
responsible for these increases. Thus without better evidence that Braun contributed to key
decisions adversely effecting Clearview's environment the editorial remains unconvincing.

Even assuming that Braun was at least partially responsible for the two increases, and that
those increases indicate a worsening environment, the editorial provides no clear evidence
that Green would be effective in reversing that trend let alone more effective than Braun. The
mere fact that Green is a member of the Good Earth Coalition hardly suffices to prove her
willingness and ability to help solve Clearview's environmental problems, at least not without
more information about that coalition and Green's involvement in it.

Finally, even if Green would in fact be more effective than Braun in solving Clearview's
environmental problems, the author provides no firm evidence that electing Green is
necessary to solve those problems, or that electing Green would suffice. Perhaps another
candidate, or another course of action, would be more effective. Even if Green does everything
in her power as city-council member to solve these problems, perhaps additional
measures--such as replacing other council members, state legislators, or even the state's
governor--would also be required in order to achieve Clearview's environmental objectives.

In sum, the editorial's author cannot justify his or her voting recommendation on the basis of
the scant evidence provided in the editorial. To bolster the recommendation the author must
provide better evidence that
* Clearview has environmental problems to begin with,
* Green would be more effective than either Braun or any other candidate in solving those
problems, and
* electing Green would suffice to solve those problems. To better assess the
argument I would need to know the scope of the city council's authority respecting
environmental decisions. I would also need to know Braun's voting record on environmental
issues, Green's experience and position on those issues, and the voters' other
choices--besides Green and Braun.
