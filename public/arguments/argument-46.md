Argument 46
---------------------------

**The Trash-Site Safety Council has recently conducted a statewide study of possible harmful
effects of garbage sites on the health of people living near the sites. A total of five sites and
300 people were examined. The study revealed, on average, only a small statistical correlation
between the proximity of homes to garbage sites and the incidence of unexplained rashes
among people living in these homes. Furthermore, although it is true that people living near the
largest trash sites had a slightly higher incidence of the rashes, there was otherwise no
correlation between the size of the garbage sites and people's health. Therefore, the council is
pleased to announce that the current system of garbage sites does not pose a significant
health hazard. We see no need to restrict the size of such sites in our state or to place any
restrictions on the number of homes built near the sites.**

The Trash-Site Council concludes here that there is no public-health reason to restrict the
size of trash sites or their proximity to homes. The Council cites its recent statewide study
involving five sites and 300 people; in the study the Council observed only a small correlation
between the residents’ proximity to a trash site and unexplained rashes, and only a “slightly
higher incidence” of rashes among people living near larger sites. The study suffers from
certain statistical and other problems, which render the Council’s argument based upon it
unpersuasive.

First, the Council has not convinced me that the five sites in the survery are representative
of trash sites in general throughout the state – in terms of their impact on the health of nearby
residents. Admittedly, the study was a “statewide” one. Nevertheless, it is entirely possible that
the five sites studied are characterized by certain environmental conditions that are not typical
of most sites in the state and which render nearby residents either more or less susceptible to
rashes and other health problems.

Secondly, the 300 people in the study are not necessarily representative of the state’s
general population – in terms of their susceptibility to health problems. For example, perhaps
nearly all of these people are adults, while most of the health problems associated with trash
sites occur among children. Or perhaps preventative health-care programs in these particular
communities are unusually effective in preventing ealth problems. In short, lacking evidence
that these 300 people are typical in terms of their vulnerability to health problems the Council
cannot convince me that no statewide trash-site regulations are needed.

Thirdly, the Council’s conclusions that the five sites studies pose no serious health hazards
to nearby residents seems premature. Common sense informs me that a serious health
problem might become apparent only after a long period of exposure to the environmental
cause of the problem. The Council fails to take into account the length of time these residents
have been exposed to the conditions created by the trash sites; and in any event, one “recent”
study amounts to scant evidence that the sites pose no significant long-term public-health
hazards.

In sum, the Council’s argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the Council
must provide better evidence that the environmental conditions at the five sites studies
represent conditions at trash sites througouth the state, and that the 300 people studies are
representative of state residents generally in terms of vulnerability to health problems. To
better assess the argument I would need more information comparing the health of the 300
people studied before and after continual exposure to the environmental conditions associated
with the trash sites. I would also need to know the length of the study to determine whether it
adequately accounted for latent health problems.
