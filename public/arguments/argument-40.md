Argument 40
---------------------------

*The following is a letter to the head of the tourism bureau on the island of Tria.*

**Erosion of beach sand along the shores of Tria Island is a serious threat to our island and our
tourist industry. In order to stop the erosion, we should charge people for using the beaches.
Although this solution may annoy a few tourists in the short term, it will reduce the number of
people using the beaches and will raise money for replenishing the sand. Replenishing the
sand, as was done to protect buildings on the nearby island of Batia, will help protect buildings
along our shores, thereby reducing these buildings' risk of additional damage from severe
storms. And since the areas along the shore will be more attractive as a result, the beaches
will be preserved and the area's tourist industry will improve over the long term.**


This letter's author recommends charging fees for public access to Tria's beaches as an
effective means of raising funds for the purpose of saving Tria's tourist industry. The author
reasons that beach-access fees would reduce the number of beachgoers while providing
revenue for replenishing beach sand needed to protect nearby buildings, thereby enhancing
the area's attractiveness to tourists. To support this argument the author points out that beach
sand was replenished on the nearby island of Batia, thereby reducing the risk of storm damage
to bL~ldin~ there. I find the argument unconconvining for several reasons.

First of all, the author makes certain dubious assumptions about the impact of beach access
fees. On the one hand, the author ignores the possibility that charging fees might deter so
many tourists that Tria would be worse off overall. On the other hand, perhaps the vast
majority of Tria's tourists and residents alike would happily pay for beach access, in which
case Tria's beaches would continue to be no less crowded than they are now. Under either
scenario, adopting the author's proposal might harm, rather than benefit, Tria's tourist industry
in the long run.

Secondly, the mere fact that on nearby Batia replenishing beach sand has served to protect
shoreline buildings is scant evidence that Tria would achieve its goals by following Batia's
example. Perhaps the same course of action would be ineffective on Tria due to geological
differences between the two islands. Or perhaps Batia is in a far better position than Tria
financially to replenish its sand on a continual basis. In short, lacking evidence that conditions
on the two islands are relevantly similar, the author cannot convince me on the basis of Batia's
experience that the proposed course of action would be effective in attaining Tria's goals.

Thirdly, even if replenishing Tria's beach sand is financially feasible and would protect
nearby buildings, the author provides no evidence that Tria's tourist industry would be saved
thereby. Perhaps Tria's tourist appeal has little to do with the beach and nearby buildings; for
that matter, perhaps Tria's tourist appeal would be greater with fewer buildings along the coast.

Since the author provides no firm evidence that replenishing sand and protecting nearby
buildings would be more beneficial to Tria's tourist industry than allowing nature to take its
course, I do not find the author's argument the least bit compelling.

In sum, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the author must show
that charging beach-access fees would reduce the number of beachgoers, but not to the
extent of undermining the goal of raising sufficient funds to maintain an attractive coastal area.

The author must also provide better evidence that replenishing sand would indeed protect
nearby buildings, and that the net result would be the enhancement of Tria's tourist industry.
