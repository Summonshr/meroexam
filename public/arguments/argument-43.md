Argument 43
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.*

**Too much emphasis is placed on the development of reading skills in elementary school.
Many students who are discouraged by the lonely activity of reading turn away from
schoolwork merely because they are poor readers. But books recorded on audiocassette tape
provide an important alternative for students at this crucial stage in their education, one the
school board should not reject merely because of the expense involved. After all, many studies
attest to the value of allowing students to hear books read aloud; there is even evidence that
students whose parents read to them are even more likely to become able readers. Thus,
hearing books on tape can only make students more eager to read and to learn. Therefore, the
school board should encourage schools to buy books on tape and to use them in elementary
education.**


This editorial concludes that the school board should invest in audiocassettes because
listening to audiocassettes makes elementary students more eager to learn and to read. To
support this conclusion the editorial cites studies showing the value of listening to someone
else read. However, dose scrutiny of this evidence and of the editorial's line of reasoning
reveals that they provide little credible support for the editorial's conclusion.

To begin with, the argument claims that for a poor reader the isolation of reading will provide
a general disincentive to do schoolwork. However, the author provides no evidence to support
this claim. It is just as possible that a child who has difficulty reading might excel at other
subjects that do not require much reading, such as mathematics or music. Besides, this
argument assumes that learning to read must be an isolated activity. Experience informs us,
however, that this is not the case, especially for elementary school students who typically learn
to read in a group environment.

The editorial goes on to cite studies which **attest to the value** of allowing students to hear
books read allowed. However, as it stands this evidence is far too vague to support the
editorial's conclusion; we are not informed whether the **value** relates specifically to reading
skills. Common sense tells me that while audiocassettes can help any person learn facts and
understand concepts, a skill such as reading can only be learned by practicing the skill itself.

Nor are we informed about the manner in which books were read allowed in the study; were
they read directly by parents or were they recorded on audiocassettes? Absent additional
information about the cited studies, these studies lend no credible support to the conclusion
that audiocassettes will help elementary school students to read and to learn.

The editorial continues by claiming that listening to audiocassettes will make children better
readers because when parents read aloud to their children these children become better
readers. This argument by analogy is wholly unpersuasive. The latter allows for interaction
between parent and child, while the former does not. The latter allows for the child to view
written words as the parent reads--that is, to read while the former does not. Besides,
common sense and experience tell us that audiocassettes, which provide for passive listening,
are likely to serve as crotches that dissuade children from active read ing--instead of
encouraging them to read.

In conclusion, the editorial is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen the argument, the
editorial's author must provide more compelling evidence that listening to audiocassettes will
actually help and encourage elementary school students to read, not just to learn in general. In
order to better evaluate the argument, we would need more information about whether the
cited studies refer specifically to the value of audiocassettes and specifically to their value in
terms of the reading and learning processes.
