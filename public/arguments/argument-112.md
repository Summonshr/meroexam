Argument 112
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a newsletter from a political organization.*

**In order to promote economic growth in the city, city residents should vote 'yes' on the state
government's proposal to build a new expressway linking the outlying suburbs directly to the
city center. A direct link to the city center will enable downtown businesses to receive deliveries
more frequently, so that downtown retailers will no longer run out of stock and city
manufacturers will not be affected by shortages of materials. Booming businesses will attract
qualified workers from all over the state, workers who will be able to take advantage of the new
expressway to commute to work in our city. In addition to these advantages, hundreds of
workers will be employed to build the expressway, further stimulating the local economy!**
In this newsletter the author concludes that, in order to promote the economic health of the
city's downtown area, voters should approve the construction of an expressway linking
downtown to outlying suburbs. To support this conclusion the author claims that the
expressway would alleviate shortages of stock and materials among downtown businesses
and manufacturers, and would attract workers from elsewhere in the state. However, the
argument relies on a series of unsubstantiated assumptions, which render it unconvincing.

The first problem with the argument involves the author's dairn that the expressway would
help prevent downtown merchants and manufacturers from experiencing shortages in stock
and materials. This claim depends on three assumptions. One assumption is that such a
problem exists in the first place. A second assumption is that the absence of an expressway is
the cause of such shortages; yet common sense tells me that the availability of these
commodities is probably the primary such factor. A third assumption is that stock and materials
would be delivered primarily via the expressway. Yet it is entirely possible that these
commodities are delivered directly to the downtown area by other means, such as rail or air
transport. Without substantiating these assumptions the author cannot justifiably conclude that
the expressway would help prevent shortages of stock and materials.

Another problem with the argument involves the author's dual claim that because of the new
expressway workers from elsewhere in the state will be lured to work in this city's downtown
area and at the same time will choose to live in the suburbs. The author provides no evidence
that the existence of an expressway would suffice to entice people to work in this city's
downtown area. Moreover, the author ignores the possibility that people who might want to
work in the city's downtown area would generally prefer to live in that area as well. In this case
the expressway would be of no help in attracting qualified workers to this city's downtown area.

A third problem with the argument is that it unfairly assumes that the expressway will result
in a net influx, rather than outflow, of workers to the downtown area. In fact, the expressway
might make it easier for people who currently live and work downtown to commute to jobs in
other areas or even relocate their businesses to outlying areas. Either scenario would serve to
undermine the author's claim that the expressway would provide a boon to the downtown
economy.

Finally, the argument rests on the assumption that funds used to build the expressway and
to create jobs for construction workers cannot be applied to some other program instead---one
that would be even more effective in promoting the health of the downtown economy. Without
identifying and weighing such alternatives, the author cannot defend the conclusion that voters
should approve the expressway project.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the author must
provide strong evidence that the expressway would help alleviate shortages of supply and
materials among downtown businesses and manufacturers. The author must also show that
the expressway would in fact result in a net influx of workers who would change jobs because
of the availability of the expressway. Finally, to better evaluate the argument we would need
more information about possible alternatives to the proposal, and whether any such alternative
would be more effective in promoting the health of the downtown economy.
