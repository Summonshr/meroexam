Argument 84
---------------------------

**The country Myria, which charges fees for the use of national parks, reports little evidence
of environmental damage. This strongly suggests that for the country Illium, the best way to
preserve public lands is to charge people more money when they are using national parks and
wilderness areas for activities with heavy environmental impact. By collecting fees from those
people who overuse public lands, Illium will help preserve those lands for present and future
generations.**

In this argument the speaker recommends that Illium's national parks charge higher fees to
visitors whose activities carry a heavy environmental impact than to other visitors, in order to
help preserve Illium's public lands for the present and future generations. To support this
recommendation the speaker points out that the country of Myria charges fees for use of its
national parks and that Myria reports little evidence of environmental damage. This argument
is flawed in several critical respects.

First, the argument assumes too hastily that the reports of conditions in Myria's parks are
accurate. It is entirely possible that the reports were based on only cursory studies, or on
studies at only a small percentage of Myria's parks; in either case the reports would amount to
scant evidence of the extent of overall environmental damage in Myria's parks. Moreover, in
my observation many environmental problems become apparent only after the passage of
considerable time. Accordingly, if the reports are based on observations made over a brief
period then the reports might be unreliable indicators of long-term environmental damage.

Even if little environmental damage has occurred at Myria's national parks, Myria's park fees
are not necessarily responsible for the lack of damage--as the argument assumes. Perhaps
the true reason for the pristine condition of these parks is that visitors engage in few activities
that carry heavy environmental impact. Or perhaps visitors or park rangers take certain
measures to mitigate the effects of those activities. For that matter, perhaps the number of
visitors to Myria's parks has always been soinsignificant that they could inflict little damage in
any event. Unless the speaker can rule out these and other possible explanations for the
pristine condition of Myria's parks, I cannot accept the further assertion that Illium would help
preserve its parks by following Myria's example.

Even assuming Myria's park fees have prevented environmental damage in those parks, the
speaker's recommendation depends on the additional assumption that the proposed fee
increase will carry the same result for IUium. Yet it is entirely possible that the vast majority of
Illium's park visitors would happily pay higher fees and continue heavy impact activities
unabated. It is also possible that certain natural conditions in Illium's parks not present in
Myria's parks exacerbate the impact of damaging activities. Thus, unless the speaker can
show that conditions in IUium and Myria are similar in all respects that might affect the
environmental impact of park fees and visitor activities, I cannot take the speaker's
recommendation seriously.

In sum, the argument depends on a series of doubtful assumptions and is therefore
unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the speaker must provide dear evidence that
Myria's park environment has in fact not been damaged by visitors and that but for its fees
Myria's parks would have incurred significantly more environmental damage. The speaker
must also show that Myria and IUium are similar in terms of the extent to which park visitors
engage in heavy-impact activities and the willingness of visitors to pay for engaging in these
activities.
