Argument 82
---------------------------

**A recent study suggests that people who are left-handed are more likely to succeed in
business than are right-handed people. Researchers studied photographs of 1,000 prominent
business executives and found that 21 percent of these executives wrote with their left hand.**

**So the percentage of prominent business executives who are left-handed (21 percent) is
almost twice the percentage of people in the general population who are left-handed (11
percent). Thus, people who are left-handed would be well advised to pursue a career in
business, whereas people who are right-handed would be well advised to imitate the business
practices exhibited by left-handers.**

This argument recommends the all left-handed people should pursue a career in business
and that right-handed people should learn to imitate the business practices of left-handed
people. To support this recommendation the speaker cites a study of 1,000 prominent
business executives, among whom 21 percent were photographed while writing with their left
hand. The speaker then points out that only 11 percent of the general population is left-handed.

The argument suffers from several logical flaws and is therefore unconvincing.

First of all, the study amounts to scant evidence of the speaker's implicit condusion that
left-handedness contributes to business success. Just because photographs show a person
writing with his or her left hand does not necessarily mean that the person is left-handed; many
people are ambidextrous--using either hand to write or using one hand to write while using the
other hand for other tasks. Besides, the 1,000 executives from the study are not necessarily
representative of the overall population of prominent business executives. Moreover, many
prominent executives might have risen to their status not by way of their achievements or
business acumen but through other means--such as familial relationships. In short, the
photographs in themselves prove little about the causal relationship between left-handedness
and the ability to succeed in business.

Even if left-handed people are more likely to have an innate ability to succeed in business
than right-handed people are, the author's conclusion that all left-handed people should
pursue business careers unfairly assumes that all left-handed people are similar in terms of
their talents, interests, and motivations. Common sense informs me that the best vocational
choice for any person depends on a variety of factors. Thus without dearer evidence that
left-handed people tend to be successful in business but unsuccessful in other vocations the
speaker cannot justify such a sweeping recommendation for left-handed people.

Even if most left-handed people would be well advised to pursue business careers, the
speaker's recommendation for right-handed people is unwarranted. Common sense informs
me that any innate business acumen with which left-handed people might be endowed cannot
be imitated. Moreover, the speaker assumes without substantiation that the way in which
left-handed people conduct business is the only way to succeed in business. It is entirely
possible that right-handed people have certain natural ways of thinking which lend themselves
better to other business approaches. Without considering and ruling out this possibility the
speaker cannot convince me that right-handed people should imitate the business practices of
left-handed people.

In sum, the argument is logically unsound. To strengthen it the speaker must show that the
1,000 executives in the photos were in fact using their dominant hand, that they are
representative of all prominent executives, and that prominence in business is generally the
result of an executive's business practices. To better assess the argument I would need to
compare the percentage of left-handed people who succeed in business with those who
succeed in other vocations. I would also need more information about the business practices
of left-handed people to determine whether they employ similar practices, and whether
right-handed people who have succeeded in business employ different practices.
