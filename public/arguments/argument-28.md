Argument 28
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a report of the Committee on Faculty Promotions and Salaries at
Elm City University.*

**During her seventeen years as a professor of botany, Professor Thomas has proved herself to
be well worth her annual salary of $50,000. Her classes are among the largest at the university,
demonstrating her popularity among students. Moreover, the money she has brought to the
university in research grants has exceeded her salary in each of the last two years. Therefore,
in consideration of Professor Thomas' demonstrated teaching and research abilities, we
recommend that she receive a $10,000 raise and a promotion to Department Chairperson;
without such a raise and promotion, we fear that Professor Thomas will leave Elm City
University for another college.**


In this report an Elm City University committee recommends increasing Professor Thomas'
salary and promoting her to Department Chairperson because of her effectiveness as a
teacher and researcher. To support this recommendation the report points out that Thomas'
classes are among the University's most popular and that last year the amount of grant money
she attracted to the University exceeded her $50,000 salary. The committee argues further
that unless the University implements its recommendation Thomas is likely to defect to another
school. For several reasons, the evidence offered in support of the recommendation provides
little credible support for it.

First, the recommendation relies on the assumption that the popularity of Thomas' classes is
attributable to her effectiveness as a teacher. Yet this assumption overlooks other possible
reasons for the popularity of these classes. Perhaps Thomas is a comparatively lenient grader;
or perhaps the classes she teaches are requirements for every science student. Without
considering and eliminating these and other possible alternative explanations for the popularity
of Thomas' classes, the committee cannot convincingly condude based on that popularity that
Thomas is an effective teacher and therefore should be granted a raise and a promotion.

Secondly, the mere fact that the amount of grant money Thomas attracted to the University
last year exceeded her salary proves nothing about either her teaching abilities or her research
abilities. Perhaps last year was an aberration, and in other years Thomas did not attract much
grant money. For that matter, perhaps many--or even most--other professors at the University
attracted even more grant money than Thomas, relative to their salary levels. Under either
scenario, Thomas would appear undeserving of the recommended raise and promotion
based on this particular criterion.

Thirdly, the report provides no evidence whatsoever regarding the likelihood that Thomas
would leave the University if she is not granted the proposed raise and promotion. Lacking
such evidence, it is entirely possible that Thomas is quite content in her current position and at
her current salary level. Thus the committee cannot justifiably rely on this daim to bolster its
recommendation.

In conclusion, the committee's recommendation is ill-founded. To strengthen it the
committee must provide dear evidence that Thomas is in fact an effective teacher--perhaps by
citing student or peer evaluations. The committee must also provide specific evidence of
Thomas' research abilities--perhaps by listing scientific journals that have published the results
of her work. Finally, to better evaluate the argument I would need more information about the
degree to which Thomas is content in her current position and at her current salary, and
whether any other University would be willing to offer her a more attractive employment
package.
