Argument 115
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memo from the sales manager of Eco-Power, a company that
manufactures tools and home appliances.*

**Many popular radio and television commercials use memorable tunes and song lyrics to call
attention to the products being advertised. Indeed, a recent study of high school students
showed that 85 percent could easily recognize the tunes used to advertise leading soft drinks
and fast-food restaurants. Despite our company's extensive advertising in magazines during
the past year, sales of our home appliances declined. Therefore, to boost company profits, we
should now switch to advertisements featuring a distinctive song.**


In this memo Eco-Power's sales manager recommends that the company switch from print
ads to ads with catchy songs in order to reverse its declining profits. To support this
recommendation the memo cites the fact that most high-school students easily recognize
tunes used to advertise leading soft-drinks and fast-food restaurants. However, the argument
is unconvincing in light of several problems.

A threshold problem with the argument is that the author assumes that the current ad strategy
is the cause of Eco-Power's declining profits. The author provides no evidence that this is the
case. It is entirely possible that other factors are responsible for the decline. Perhaps the
demand for all tools and home appliances generally has slowed; or perhaps Eco-Power's
management or pricing policies are to blame. Without ruling out such possibilities, the author
cannot persuade me that switching ad strategies would reverse Eco-Power's declining profits.

Another problem with the argument involves the memo's reliance on the high rate of
tune-recognition among teenagers. For two reasons, this evidence lends little credible support
for the recommended strategy. First, even if Eco-Power were to achieve a high rate of
tune-recognition among teenagers, this demographic group is not the same group that
purchases tools and home appliances. Secondly, even assuming Eco-Power can achieve a
high tune-recognition rate among its target demographic group, this fact alone is no guarantee
that these consumers would be more likely to buy Eco-Power products as a result of
recognizing the company's tunes.

A third problem with the argument is that it assumes that the increased sales due to a high
tune-recognition rate would outweigh the costs of achieving this rate. However, a tune can be
communicated only via such media as radio and television; and real-world experience informs
us that these advertising media are more costly than print media. Although leading soft-drink
and fast-food companies can well afford the costs of producing effective tunes and of ensuring
that these tunes are heard again and again by many, many consumers, Eco-Power might lack
the resources to ensure the sort of tune recognition which these other companies have
achieved. Unless the sales manager can convince us that the proposed ad strategy will be
cost effective, his conclusion that this strategy will result in increased profits for Eco-Power is
untenable.

In condusion, the sales manager has not provided a convincing argument for the proposed
ad strategy. To strengthen the argument the manager must show that the current ad strategy is
in fact the cause of Eco-Power's declining profits. The manager must also provide strong
evidence that the people who buy the kinds of tools Eco-Power sells would hear the
company's tunes frequently enough to immediately associate the tune with the company, and
that this association would cause these listeners to buy Eco Power products. Finally, to better
evaluate the argument we would need a detailed cost benefit analysis of the proposed ad
strategy.
