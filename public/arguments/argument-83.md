Argument 83
---------------------------

*The following is a letter from an editor at Liber Publishing Company to the company's
president.*

**In recent years, Liber has unfortunately moved away from its original mission: to publish the
works of regional small-town authors instead of those of big-city authors. Just last year, 90
percent of the novels we published were written by authors who maintain a residence in a big
city. Although this change must have been intended to increase profits, it has obviously
backfired, because Liber is now in serious financial trouble. The only way to address this
problem is to return to our original mission. If we return to publishing only the works of regional
small-town authors, our financial troubles will soon be resolved.**


An editor at Liber Publishing contends here that Liber will become profitable again if and
only it returns to its original mission of publishing works primarily by small-town authors. To
support this contention the editor cites the fact that since moving away from that mission Liber
has become unprofitable. The editor's argument suffers from a series of logical problems, and
is therefore wholly unpersuasive.

To begin with, the editor's recommendation depends on the assumption that no factors other
than Liber's shift to big-city authors caused Liber's declining profits. However, common sense
informs me that this assumption is a poor one. A myriad of other factors, including
management and marketing problems, or shifting demand among book buyers, might just as
likely be the cause of Hber's declining profits. Without ruling out these and other possible
causes, the editor cannot justifiably conclude that by renaming to its original mission Liber will
return to profitability.

Even assuming Liber's move away from small-town authors was the cause of its dedining
profits, the editor's argument suffers from two classic fallacies which render the
recommendation indefensible. First, the editor infers that the only way for Liber to retum to
profitability is to return to its original mission. Yet absent evidence to the contrary, other means
of boosting its profits might also be available. Secondly, the editor infers that returning to its
original mission is a sufficient condition for Liber's returning to profitability. This inference is
also fallacious, at least without additional evidence to support it.

Finally, a careful reading of the argument reveals two additional problems. The editor
indicates that 90% of Liber's novels are written by authors who maintain a residence in a big
city. However, the editor fails to indicate whether these authors also maintain residences in
small towns. If they do, then Liber has not in fact departed from its original mission, and the
editor's argument is essentially moot. In addition, the editor fails to indicate what percentage of
Liber's publications are novels; the lower the percentage the less likely that Liber has in fact
departed from its original mission.

In conclusion, the editor's argument cannot be taken seriously as it stands. To strengthen it,
the editor must show that Liber has in fact departed from its original mission, and that this
departure was the actual cause of Liber's declining profits. To better evaluate the argument we
would need to know what other means, if any, are available to Liber to help return the company
to profitability.
