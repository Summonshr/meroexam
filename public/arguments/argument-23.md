Argument 23
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memo from the mayor of the town of Hopewell.*

**Two years ago, the town of Ocean View built a new municipal golf course and resort hotel.
During the past two years, tourism in Ocean View has increased, new businesses have
opened there, and Ocean View's tax revenues have risen by 30 percent. The best way to
improve Hopewell's economy, and generate additional tax revenues, is to build a golf course
and resort hotel similar to those in Ocean View.**


In this memo HopeweU's mayor recommends that in order to stimulate the town's economy
and boost tax revenues HopeweU should build a new golf course and resort hotel, just as the
town of Ocean View did two years ago. To support this recommendation the mayor points out
that in Ocean View during the last two years tourism has increased, new businesses have
opened, and tax revenues have increased by 30%. I find the mayor's argument unconvincing
in several important respects.

First of all, it is possible that the mayor has confused cause with effect respecting the recent
developments in Ocean View. Perhaps Ocean View's construction of a new golf course and
hotel was a response to previous increases in tourism and business development increases
that have simply continued during the most recent two years. Since the mayor has failed to
account for this possibility, the claim that Hopewell would boost its economy by also
constructing a golf course and hotel is completely unwarranted.

Secondly, the mayor fails to account for other possible causes of the trends in Ocean View
during the last two years. The increase in tourism might have been due to improving economic
conditions nationwide, or to unusually pleasant weather in the region. The new businesses
that have opened in Ocean View might have opened there irrespective of the new golf course
and hotel. And, the 30% increase in tax revenues might have been the result of an increase in
tax rates, or the addition of a new type of municipal tax.

Without ruling out these and other alternative explanations for the three recent trends in
Ocean View, the mayor cannot reasonably infer based on those trends that Hopewell's
economy would benefit by following Ocean View's example.

Thirdly, even if the recent trends in Ocean View are attributable to the construction of the new
golf course and hotel there, the mayor assumes too hastily that the golf course and hotel will
continue to benefit that town's overall economy. The mayor has not accounted for the
possibility that increased tourism will begin to drive residents away during tourist season, or
that new business development will result in the town's losing its appeal as a place to visit or to
live. Unless the mayor can convince me that these scenarios are unlikely I cannot accept the
mayor's recommendation that Hopewell follow Ocean View's example.

Finally, the mayor's argument rests on the unsubstantiated assumption that Hopewell and
Ocean View are sufficiently alike in ways that might affect the economic impact of a new golf
course and hotel. Hopewell might lack the sort of natural environment that would attract more
tourists and new businesses to the town--regardless of its new golf course and hotel. For that
matter, perhaps Hopewell already contains several resort hotels and golf courses that are not
utilized to their capacity. If so, building yet another golf course and hotel might amount to a
misallocation of the town's resources--and actually harm the town's overall economy.

In sum, the mayor's recommendation is not well supported. To bolster it the mayor must
provide better evidence that Ocean View's new golf course and hotel and not some other
phenomenon--has been responsible for boosting Ocean View's economy during the last two
years. To better assess the recommendation I would need to know why Ocean View decided
to construct its new golf course and hotel in the first place--specifically, what events prior to
construction might have prompted that decision. I would also need to thoroughly compare
HopeweU with Ocean View--especially in terms of their appeal to tourists and businesses--to
determine whether the same course of action that appears to have boosted Ocean View's
economy would also boost Hopewell's economy.
