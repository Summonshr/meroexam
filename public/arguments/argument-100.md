Argument 100
---------------------------

**In each city in the region of Treehaven, the majority of the money spent on government-run
public school education comes from taxes that each city government collects. The region's
cities differ, however, in the value they place on public education. For example, Parson City
typically budgets twice as much money per year as Blue City does for its public schools---even
though both cities have about the same number of residents. It seems clear, therefore, that
Parson City residents care more about public school education than do Blue City residents.**

This argument concludes that Parson City residents value public-school education more
highly than Blue City residents do. To justify this conclusion the argument points out that in
both cities the majority of funds for public schools comes from taxes, and that Blue City
budgets only half as much money per year for its public schools as Parson City, even though
the population in both cities is about the same. The argument relies on a series of
unsubstantiated assumptions, which considered together render the argument wholly
unconvincing.

One such assumption is that the total budget for the two cities is about the same. It is
entirely possible that Blue City's total budget is no more than half that of Parson City. If so, then
the fact that Blue City budgets only half as much as Parson City for its public schools would
suggest at least the same degree of care about public-school education among Blue City's
residents as among Parson City's residents.

Even if Parson City devotes a greater percentage of its budget each year for its schools, the
argument relies on the additional assumption that this percentage is a reliable indicator of the
value a city's residents place on public-school education. Yet it is entirely possible, for example,
that Blue City's schools are already well funded, or that Blue City has some other, extremely
urgent problem which requires additional funding despite a high level of concern among its
residents about its public schools. Absent evidence that the two city's various needs are similar,
any comparison between the level of concern about public schools among residents in the two
dries based simply on funds spent for public schools is dubious at best.

A third assumption upon which the argument rests is that the percentage of residents who
attend public schools is about the same in both cities. The argument indicates only that the
total population of the two dries is about the same. If a comparatively small percentage of Blue
City residents attend public schools, then the comparatively small amount of money Blue City
devotes to those schools might be well justified despite an equal level of concern about the
quality of public-school education among residents in the two dries.

Finally, although the argument states that in both cities **the majority** of money spent on
public schools comes from taxes, perhaps the actual percentage is smaller in Blue City than in
Parson City, and other such funds come from residents' donations, earmarked for public
education. Compliance with tax laws is scant evidence of taxpayer support of pub lic-school
education, while voluntary giving is strong evidence. Thus it is possible that Blue City residents
donate more money per capita for public-school education than Parson City residents do. If so,
this fact would seriously weaken the argument that Blue City residents place a comparatively
low value on public-school education.

In sum, the argument is unpersuasive as it stands. To strengthen it the argument's proponent
must provide clear evidence that the percentage of the budget allotted to public
schools, as well as the percentage of money spent on public schools and derived from taxes,
is about the same in both dries. To better assess the argument I would need to compare the
neediness of Blue City's public schools with that of Parson's public schools. I would also need
more information about other urgent financial needs in each city, and about the other sources
of the money applied toward public-school education in each city.
