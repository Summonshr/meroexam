Argument 125
---------------------------

*The following appeared as an editorial in the student newspaper of Groveton College.*

**To combat the recently reported dramatic rise in cheating among college and university
students, these institutions should adopt honor codes similar to Groveton's, which calls for
students to agree not to cheat in their academic endeavors and to notify a faculty member if
they suspect that others have cheated. Groveton's honor code replaced an old-fashioned
system in which students were closely monitored by teachers and an average of thirty cases of
cheating per year were reported. The honor code has proven far more successful: in the first
year it was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this
figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey conducted by the Groveton honor
council, a majority of students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in
place than without.**

In this editorial the author concludes that colleges should adopt an honor code for detecting
academic cheating. To support this condusion the author points out that the first year after
switching from a monitoring system to an honor system the annual number of reported
cheating incidents at Groveton College decreased from 30 to 21, and that five years later the
number was only 14. The author also cites a survey in which most students indicated they
would be less likely to cheat under an honor system than if they are closely monitored. This
argument is unconvincing for several reasons.

First and foremost, the argument relies on the assumptions that Groveton students are just
as capable of detecting cheating as faculty monitors, and that these students are just as likely
to report cheating whenever they observe it. However, without evidence to substantiate these
assumptions one cannot reasonably conclude that the honor code has in fact resulted in a
decline in the incidence of cheating at Groveton. Besides, common sense tells me that these
assumptions are dubious at best; an impartial faculty observer is more likely to detect and
report cheating than a preoccupied student under peer pressure not to report cheating among
classmates.

The argument also assumes that during the five-year period all other conditions possibly
affecting the reported incidence of cheating at Groveton remained unchanged. Such
conditions include the number of Groveton students and the overall integrity of the student
body. After five years it is entirely possible that these conditions have changed, and that the
reported decrease in cheating is attributable to one or more such changes. Thus, without ruling
out such alternative explanations for the reported decrease, the author cannot convince me
that the honor code has in fact contributed to a decline in the incidence of cheating at
Groveton.

The author's recommendation that other colleges follow Groveton's example depends on
the additional assumption that Groveton is typical in ways relevant to the incidence of cheating.

However, this is not necessarily the case. For instance, perhaps Groveton students are more
or less likely to report cheating, or to cheat under an honor system, than typical college
students. Lacking evidence that Groveton students are typical in these respects, the argument
is indefensible.

Finally, the survey that the author cites might be unreliable in any of three respects. First, the
author fails to assure us that the survey's respondents are representative of all college
students. Second, the survey results depend on the honesty and integrity of the respondents.

Third, hypothetical predictions about one's future behavior are inherently less reliable than
reports of proven behavior. Lacking evidence that the survey is reliable, the author cannot
reasonably rely on the survey in recommending that other colleges adopt an honor code.

In conclusion, to persuade me that other colleges should adopt an honor code in order to
reduce cheating, the author must supply clear evidence that cheating at Groveton in fact
decreased after the honor code was instituted there, and that it is this code that was
responsible for the decrease. Finally, to better assess the usefulness of the survey I would
need specific information about the survey's sampling methodology.
