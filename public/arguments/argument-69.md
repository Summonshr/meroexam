Argument 69
---------------------------

*From a letter to the editor of a city newspaper.*

**One recent research study has indicated that many adolescents need more sleep than they
are getting, and another study has shown that many high school students in our city are
actually dissatisfied with their own academic performance. As a way of combating these
problems, the high schools in our city should begin classes at 8:30 A.M. instead of 7:30 A.M.,
and end the school day an hour later. This arrangement will give students an extra hour of
sleep in the morning, thereby making them more alert and more productive. Consequently, the
students will perform better on tests and other assignments, and their academic skills will
improve significantly.**


This letter concludes that the academic performance of local high school students would
improve if the daily school schedule were to begin and end one hour later. To support this
recommendation the letter's author cites two studies, one showing that adolescents generally
do not get enough sleep, the other showing that many local high school stu dents are
dissatisfied with their academic performance. The recommendation relies on a series of
unsubstantiated assumptions about the habits of high school students and about the studies
themselves. As a result, the letter is not convincing.

First of all, the letter's recommendation depends on the doubtful assumption that by
beginning classes one hour later students will sleep one hour longer each night. Experience
tells us, however, that this will not necessarily be the case. Just as likely, students will adjust to
the new schedule by falling asleep one hour later. Moreover, by staying up one hour later at
night students might very well engage in the sort of late-night social or even delinquent
activities that would disrupt their productivity at school.

Secondly, the letter's conclusion relies on the assumption that one additional hour of sleep
would in fact result in improved academic performance. While this might be the case, the letter
provides no evidence to substantiate this assumption. It is entirely possible that one hour of
additional sleep would not suffice. Moreover, the letter provides no evidence that the students
who are dissatisfied with their academic performance are also the ones who would benefit
from the new schedule. It is entirely possible that these particular students already sleep
longer than most other students, or that their academic performance is already optimal.

Conversely, it is entirely possible that those students whose academic performance could
stand the greatest improvement would be unmotivated to become better students regardless
of how much they sleep each night.

A final problem with the argument involves the two studies themselves. The letter pro vides
no information about how either study was conducted. Without knowing whether the sample of
adolescents studied was representative of the overall high school population in the city, it is
impossible to confidently apply the studies' results to that population. Moreover, we are not
informed about the size of the sample in either study; the smaller the sample, the less reliable
the study's conclusion.

In conclusion, this letter's recommendation for beginning and ending the high school day
one hour later is not well justified. To strengthen the argument, the author must provide clear
evidence that adjusting the schedule will in fact result in the students' sleeping longer each
night, and that this additional sleep will in fact improve their academic performance. To better
assess the author's recommendation, we would need more information about the sampling
method used in the two studies.
