Argument 79
---------------------------

*The following is a letter from a professor at Xanadu College to the college's president.*

**The development of an extensive computer-based long-distance learning program will
enhance the reputation of Xanadu College. This program would allow more students to enroll
in our courses, thereby increasing our income from student tuition. Traditional courses could
easily be adapted for distance learners, as was shown by the adaptation of two traditional
courses for our distance learning trial project last year. Also, by using computer programs and
taped lectures, faculty will have fewer classroom obligations and more time to engage in
extensive research, thereby enhancing the reputation of Xanadu.**


In this letter a Xanadu College professor asserts that the development of an extensive
distance-learning program would enhance the college's reputation, as well as increasing total
enrollment and therefore total tuition income. To support this assertion the professor points out
that in last year's trial program two traditional courses were easily adapted for distance
learning. Next, the professor reasons that with more free time faculty could engage in
extensive research, which in turn would enhance the college's reputation. The argument is
flawed in several critical respects.

First of all, the professor's dalm that an increase in enrollment would result in an increase in
tuition income is warranted only if Xanadu students would be willing to pay a sufficiently high
fee for distance-learning courses. However, it is entirely possible that Xanadu's distance
learning courses would not command as high a fee as its traditional courses, and that
Xanadu's total tuition income would actually decline if this less expensive alternative were
available to Xanadu students.

Secondly, the professor's dual claims about distance learning--that it would enhance
Xanadu's reputation and that it would increase enrollment and income--might very well be
mutually exclusive altematives. The availability of distance-learning courses might actually
diminish Xanadu's overall reputation for quality education. Without addressing this issue the
professor cannot justifiably conclude that the distance-learning alternative would achieve both
goals.

A third problem with the argument involves last year's trial project. Despite the fact that two
particular courses were easily adapted to distance learning, other courses might not be as
adaptable. Common sense informs me that certain courses, especially in the arts, require
hands-on learning to be effective. Thus the professor cannot justify her claim oll the basis of
the trial project.

Finally, the professor's claim that distance learning would afford Xanadu faculty more free
time to engage in extensive research raises two problems. First, it is possible that the time
needed for faculty to adapt their courses for distance learning would equal or even exceed the
time they would save by not teaching traditional classes. Second, even if a net time savings
does result, the professor provides no evidence that Xanadu faculty would actually use this
extra free time for research, or that additional research would in fact enhance Xanadu's
reputation.

In condusion, the argument is indefensible as it stands. To strengthen it the professor must
provide specific information about Xanadu's current reputation, and provide clear evidence
that distance learning would in fact enhance this reputation. The professor must also convince
us that the two courses in the trial project were representative of Xanadu's other courses--in
terms of the ease with which the faculty could adapt their courses to distance learning. Finally,
to better assess the argument we would need a detailed analysis comparing loss in tuition from
traditional-course enrollment with expected gains in tuition from distance-learning enrollment.
