Argument 94
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memo from the human resources department of Rifco Computer
Company to the company president.*

**In order to prevent conflicts in the workplace, Rifco Computer Company should require all its
employees to attend workshops that teach the technique of active listening, a technique in
which people express feelings without assigning blame. This technique has clearly benefited
Terland Publishing Company: five years ago, two hundred recently hired Terland employees
volunteered to participate in a one-day active-listening workshop. Five years later, only five
percent of these employees had filed formal complaints with the human resources department,
whereas the company as a whole had a fifteen percent complaint rate during that period.**


This memo's author concludes that to prevent workplace conflicts at Rifco Computer all
employees should attend active-listening workshops. To justify this conclusion the author
points out that five years ago 200 new workers at Terland Publishing volunteered for a one-day
active-listening workshop, and that since then only 5% percent of those volunteers have filed
formal complaints with Terland's human-resources department, compared to 15% of Terland's
overall work force. The argument is unconvincing for several reasons.

First of all, the author assumes too hastily that the workshop at Terland, rather than some
other phenomenon, was responsible for the comparatively low incidence of formal complaints
by the workshop volunteers. Perhaps people who volunteer for such workshops tend to have
better interpersonal skills to begin with, and are therefore less likely to find reason to complain
about coworkers in any event. Moreover, a one-day **active listening'' workshop is unlikely to
have a lasting impact; were the workshop held more recently I would be more willing to accept
the proposition that it was the reason for the low incidence of complaints among its attendees.

Secondly, even if the comparatively low incidence of complaints by Terland's workshop
attendees is attributable to the workshop, the memo's conclusion rests on the additional
assumption that the incidence of formal complaints is an accurate indicator of the level of
workplace conflict. Yet the incidence of formal complaints might be a function of some other
factor instead---such as an employee's tenure. New employees might be less prone than other
workers to file formal complaints--possibly for fear of losing their jobs during a probation period.

For that matter, perhaps most serious workplace conflicts calling for formal complaint come to
a head only after many years of tension between workers; if so, this would provide an equally
convincing explanation for the lower incidence of complaints among newer workers.

Thirdly, even if Terland's workshop volunteers did learn from the workshop to get along
better with coworkers, the author unfairly assumes that similar workshops WIU carry a similar
result at Rifco. Terland is an entirely different business than Rifco; accordingly, perhaps the
ways in which workers at Terland interrelate are unlike those at Rifco. Or perhaps people who
work in publishing are generally more irascible or mercurial than computer-industry workers.

For that matter, perhaps Rifco employees are insufficiently motivated to benefit from the
workshop--for whatever reason. In short, lacking evidence that Rifco employees match the
profile of the volunteers at Terland in terms of the likelihood that they will respond similarly to
similar workshops--the author's claim that the proposed workshops will prevent workplace
conflict at Rifco is dubious at best.

In sum, the recommendation depends on a series of poor assumptions and is therefore
unpersuasive. To strengthen it the author must consider and rule out all other possible reasons
for the relatively low incidence of complaints by Terland's workshop attendees. The author
must also show that the incidence of formal complaints is a fair measure of worker conflict.

Finally, the author must show that workers at Rifco are similar to the volunteers at Terland in
terms of their willingness and ability to respond favorably to the proposed workshops.
