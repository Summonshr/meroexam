Argument 63
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a letter to the school board in the town of Centerville.*

**All students should be required to take the driver's education course at Centerville High
School. In the past two years several accidents in and around Centerville have involved
teenage drivers. Since a number of parents in Centerville have complained that they are too
busy to teach their teenagers to drive, some other instruction is necessary to ensure that these
teenagers are safe drivers. Although there are two driving schools in Centerville, parents on a
tight budget cannot afford to pay for driving instruction. Therefore an effective and mandatory
program sponsored by the high school is the only solution to this serious problem.**


This letter recommends mandatory driver's education courses at Centerville High School.

The author bases this recommendation on three facts: during the last two years several
Centerville car accidents have involved teenage drivers; Centerville parents are too busy to
teach driving to their children; and the two private driver-education courses in the area are
expensive. As discussed below, the argument suffers from several critical flaws and is
therefore unpersuasive.

First of all, the letter fails to indicate who or what caused the car accidents to which the letter
refers. If Centerville High School students caused the accidents, and if those accidents would
have been avoided had these students enrolled in the high school's driving course, then the
argument would have merit. However, it is equally likely that the other drivers were at fault, or
that no driver was at fault. Moreover, it is entirely possible that the teenage drivers had in fact
taken the high school's driving course, or that they were not local high school students in the
first place. The author must rule out all these possibilities in order to conclude confidently that
a school-sponsored mandatory driving course would have prevented these accidents.

Secondly, whether the fact that several car accidents the last two years involved teenage
drivers suggests a need for a mandatory driving course depends partly on the comparative
accident rate during earlier years. It is entirely possible, for instance, that the rate of accidents
involving teenagers has been steadily declining, and that this decline is due to the availability
of the two private driving courses. Without ruling out this possibility, the letter's conclusion is
not defensible.

The argument is problematic in certain other respects as well. It assumes that a mandatory
school-sponsored course would be effective, yet provides no evidence to support this
assumption. Similarly, the argument fails to substantiate its assumption that a significant
percentage of Centerville's parents cannot afford private driving instruction for their teenage
children. Absent substantiating evidence for either of these necessary assumptions, I cannot
be convinced that Centerville should establish the proposed driving course.

In conclusion, the letter's author fails to adequately support the recommendation for a
school-sponsored mandatory driving course. To strengthen the argument, the author must
provide clear evidence that Centerville High School students caused the accidents in question,
and that a mandatory driving course would have prevented them. To better evaluate the
argument, I would need more information about the affordability of the two private driving
courses and about the effectiveness of a mandatory school-sponsored course compared to
that of the two private courses.
