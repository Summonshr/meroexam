Argument 32
---------------------------

**According to a poll of 200 charitable organizations, donations of money to nonprofit groups
increased by nearly 25 percent last year, though not all charities gained equally. Religious
groups gained the most (30 percent), followed by environmental groups (23 percent), whereas
educational institutions experienced only a very small increase in donations (3 percent). This
poll indicates that more people are willing and able to give money to charities but that funding
for education is not a priority for most people. These differences in donation rates must result
from the perception that educational institutions are less in need of donations than are other
kinds of institutions.**

In this argument the author cites a poll showing that the amount of charitable donations
increased last year, but that the increase to educational institutions was far less than to either
religious or environmental groups. Based on this evidence the author condudes that more
people are willing and able to make charitable donations, but that education is not a priority for
most people. The author also concludes that the discrepancy among donation rates is the
result of a general perception that educational institutions are in less need of money than other
insttutons are. This argument depends on several unsubstanuated assumptions and is
therefore unpersuasive as it stands.

First of all, the author's conclusions about people's willingness to donate to the three types
of charities listed depend on the assumption that the poll results are statistically reliable. Yet,
the author offers no evidence to substantiate this assumption. The author must show that the
200 charitable organizations polled constitute a sufficiently large sample of religious,
environmental, and educational charities, and that this sample is representative of all such
charities. Otherwise, the author cannot confidently draw any general conclusions about the
willingness of people to donate to these three types of institutions, or about general
perceptions regarding the needs of any such institutions.

Similarly, the author's sweeping claim that **more people are willing and able to give money
to charities** depends on the assumption that the poll results are sufficiently representative of
charitable giving in general. Yet, the author offers no evidence to substantiate this assumption.

The author must show that the 25% total increase in the rate of donations to the three types of
institutions polled is representative of the increase in donations to all types of charities. The
author must also show that the total number of donors actually increased last year; as it stands
the argument leaves open the possibility that the total number of donors decreased last year
while the average amount given by each donor increased. Absent evidence to support these
assumptions, the author's broad contusion that **more people are willing and able** to make
charitable donations is dubious at best.

Additionally, the author provides no evidence whatsoever for the claim that educational
institutions are perceived as less needy than other institutions, or that this perception explains
the lower donation rate to educational institutions. Lacking such evidence, there are many
other possible explanations for the discrepancy in donation rates. Perhaps people's perception
is that educational institutions are more likely than the other types to squander or misuse
donated money; or perhaps most donors are simply more interested in advocating religions or
environmental protection than in subsidizing education. For that matter, perhaps among all
charitable organizations educational institutions ranked third last year in terms of gifts received
bettered only by religious and environmental charities. Such evidence would serve to
undermine the author's claim that funding for education is **not a priority for most people.**


In conclusion, the argument is indefensible as it stands. To strengthen it the author must
assure me that the poll results accurately reflect donation rates not only to all religious,
environmental, and educational institutions but also to the broader group of all charitable
institutions. The author must also provide clear evidence for the claimed perception about the
need of educational institutions and that this perception, and not some other factor, explains
the comparatively low donation rate to these institutions.
