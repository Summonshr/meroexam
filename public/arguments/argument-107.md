Argument 107
---------------------------

*The following article appeared in a recent issue of a college newspaper.*

**Among all students who graduated from Hooper University over the past five years, more
physical science majors than social science majors found permanent jobs within a year of
graduation. In a survey of recent Hooper University graduates, most physical science majors
said they believed that the prestige of Hooper University's physical science programs helped
them significantly in finding a job. In contrast, social science majors who found permanent
employment attributed their success to their own personal initiative. Therefore, to ensure that
social science majors find permanent jobs, Hooper University should offer additional social
science courses and hire several new faculty members who already have national reputations
in the social sciences.**


This article concludes that in order to help its new social-science graduates find permanent
jobs Hooper University should enhance its reputation in this field by adding courses and hiring
eminent faculty. To support this claim the letter points out that more physical science than
social-science students find permanent jobs within a year after graduation. The letter also cites
a survey in which the former group of graduates attributed their job finding success to the
prestige of Hooper's physical science department, while the latter group attributed their
job-finding success to their own initiative. However, careful scrutiny of the argument reveals
various statistical and other logical problems, which render it unconvincing.

To begin with, the survey that the argument cites is potentially problematic in three respects.

First, we are not informed whether the survey's respondents were representativeof the overall
population of recent Hooper graduates in these two fields. The smaller the sample, the greater
the possibility for biased results, and the less reliable the survey. Second, the survey reflects
the graduates' subjective **beliefs** about why they obtained jobs; yet it is entirely possible
these beliefs are not in accord with the true reason why they obtained jobs. Third, we are
informed that the survey involved **recent** Hooper graduates; however, if the only graduates
surveyed were those from last year's class, then the survey results would be less reliable than
if the survey embraced a wider range of graduating classes. The smaller the range the less
reliable any general conclusions drawn from the survey.

Even assuming the statistics that the letter cites are reliable, the letter's daim that the
proposed course of action will achieve its intended result assumes a sufficient job market for
social-science graduates. However, it is entirely possible that the number of jobs for
physical-science graduates greatly exceeds the number of jobs for social-science graduates,
and that this is the reason for the disparity m job-finding success between the two groups. In
fact, real-world observation suggests that this is a reasonable explanation for the disparity.

Moreover, the letter fails to account for the possibility that the latter group of graduates are less
likely than the former group to be interested in immediate employment--electing instead to
pursue graduate-level study. Without accounting for these possibilities, the letter's author
cannot justifiably conclude that the proposed course of action will boost the employment rate
of new social-science graduates.

A third problem with the argument is that it unfairly infers that the proposed course of action
is the only means of achieving the desired result. The letter's author overlooks other possible
means of ensuring that social-science students find immediate employment--such as co-op
programs, job seminars, and so forth. Without ruling out alternative means of achieving the
same goal, the author cannot convince me that the proposed course of action is needed.

In conclusion, as it stands the argument is unconvincing. To strengthen it the author must
provide strong evidence that the survey's respondents were statistically representative of all
recent Hooper graduates in these two fields of study. The author must also rule out all other
possible explanations for the disparity between job-finding success between the two groups of
Hooper graduates. Finally, to better evaluate the argument I would need more information
about the portion of graduates in each field pursuing immediate employment, and what
alternative means are available to help ensure that Hooper's new social-science graduates
find permanent employment.
