Argument 120
---------------------------

*The following appeared as part of an article in a local Beauville newspaper.*

**According to a government report, last year the city of Dillton reduced its corporate tax rate by
15 percent; at the same time, it began offering relocation grants and favorable rates on city
utilities to any company that would relocate to Dillton. Within 18 months, two manufacturing
companies moved to Dillton, where they employ a total of 300 people. Therefore, the fastest
way for Beauville to stimulate economic development and hence reduce unemployment is to
provide tax incentives and other financial inducements that encourage private companies to
relocate here.**


This article argues that the fastest way for Beauville to stimulate its economic development
and reduce unemployment would be to provide the same kinds of tax and financial incentives
for business as the incentives which the city of Dillton began providing 18 months ago. Dillton's
incentives included a reduced corporate tax rate as well as relocation grants and favorable
utility rates for businesses willing to relocate to DiUton. The article points out that during the
last 18 months two manufacturing companies, which together now employ 300 people,
relocated to Dillton. The argument is logically unconvincing in several respects.

To begin with, the argument depends on the assumption that the two businesses moving to
DiUton did so because of Dillton's new incentives--rather than for some other reason. Yet
lacking evidence to the contrary it is entirely possible that the two businesses were morivated
primarily by Dillton's climate, labor pool, or some other factor. Without ruling out all other
reasons why the two businesses might have relocated to DiUton, the argument that BeauviUe
can entice businesses to move to BeauviUe by offering similar incenrives is dubious at best.

Even if it was Dillton's new incentives that enticed the two manufacturers to Dillton, the
argument relies on the further assumption that the two firms' relocating to Dillton in fact had a
beneficial impact on the city's economy. Yet the only evidence the article offers to substantiate
this assumption is that the two manufacturers now employ 300 people. Perhaps those 300
employees left other jobs in DiUton to go to work for those two finns; if so, then the incentives
had no positive impact on Dillton's employment rate. Or perhaps other businesses have left
Dillton during the last 18 months, taking even more job opportunities with them. For that matter,
perhaps on average more businesses relocated to DiUton each year prior to DiUton's
establishing the new incentives than afterwards. In short, without more information about
DiUton's economic conditions and employment level both before and after the incentives were
established it is impossible to assess whether those incentives had a positive or negative
impact--or any impact at all--on DiUton's overall economy.

Even if Dillton's new incentives did in fact serve to help Dillton's economy, the arride unfairly
assumes that similar incentives will carry a similar result for BeauviUe. It is entirely possible
that the two dries differ in ways that would undermine the effectiveness of similar incentives for
BeauviUe. For instance, perhaps BeauviUe's labor pool is smaller; or perhaps unemployed
BeauviUe residents would be less willing or able to go to work if offered the chance. Without
accounting for such differences any analogy between the two cities is premanare, and any
conclusion based on that analogy is unjustified. Furthermore, the author's inference that
incentives which were effective in the past will also be effective in the future rests on the poor
assumption that during the last 18 months all conditions upon which their effectiveness
depend have remained unchanged. Perhaps the general economy is expected to turn down.

Or perhaps other dries have recently begun to provide similar incentives. Indeed, the fact that
DiUton is already providing these incentives might actually portend failure for Beauville, which
might need to devise even stronger incentives to convince businesses to move to BeauviUe
rather than Dillton.

Finally, the article fails to consider any other course of action that might help Beauville attain
the same economic goals. Perhaps by improving its schools or hospitals, or by reducing its
crime rate, BeauviUe can just as quickly and effectively attract new businesses and achieve its
economic objectives. In short, without weighing the proposal against alternatives, the artide's
daim that the proposed incentives are the **best** means of achieving Beauville's objectives is
wholly unconvincing.

To sum up, the article has not convinced me that the proposed incentives would be the best
way for Beauville to achieve its economic goals. To bolster the argument the article's author
must provide clear evidence that Dillton's incentives--and not some other phenomenon-were in
fact responsible for stimulating Dillton's economy during the last 18 months. To better assess
the argument I would need to know what other conditions in Beauville that were not present in
Dillton might dissuade businesses from moving to Beauville--despite the proposed incentives.

I would also need to compare near-term economic forecasts with economic conditions during
the last 18 months. Finally, I would need to consider the proposed incentives in light of
alternative courses of action.
