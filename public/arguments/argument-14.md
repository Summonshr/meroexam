Argument 14
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper from a citizen of the state
of Impecunia.*

**Two years ago our neighboring state, Lucria, began a state lottery to supplement tax
revenues for education and public health. Today, Lucria spends more per pupil than we do,
and Lucria's public health program treats far more people than our state's program does. If we
were to establish a state lottery like the one in Lucria, the profits could be used to improve our
educational system and public health program. The new lottery would doubtless be successful,
because a survey conducted in our capital city concludes that citizens of Impecunia already
spend an average of $50 per person per year on gambling.**


In this editorial the author condudes that by establishing a lottery the state of Impecunia
could use the profits from it to improve the state's education and public health programs. To
support this conclusion the author points out that the neighboring state of Lucria established a
lottery two years ago, and that today Lucria spends more per pupil and treats more people
through its health programs than Impecunia does. The editorial also cites a study showing that
the average Impecunia resident now spends $50 per year on gambling. In several respects,
however, the evidence lends little credible support for the argument.

First of all, the fact that Lucria now spends more than Impecunia per pupil, in itself, lends no
support to the argument. Perhaps Lucria has always placed a high priority on education; or
perhaps Lucria has always had more funds than Impecunia to spend on its programs,
including education. Lacking dearer evidence that Lucria's lottery successfully raised revenues
that were then used to increase the amount spent per pupil, the author cannot expect us to
take seriously the claim that by establishing a similar lottery Impecunia would improve its
education programs.

Similarly, the fact that Lucria's health programs treat more people than Impecunia's
programs lends no support to the argument. Perhaps Lucria's population is greater than
Impecunia's; or perhaps its residents are older, on average, than Impecunia's residents, and
therefore require a greater measure of health care. Without considering and ruling out these
and other possible explanations for the distinction cited, the author cannot justifiably conclude
that Lucria's lottery was responsible for improved health care in that state or that a similar
lottery in Impecunia would carry a similar result.

Moreover, the argument unfairly assumes that the lottery in Lucria has been profitable. The
author provides no evidence that this is the case. It is entirely possible that the money used for
education and health care in Lucria comes from sources other than the lottery. Without
accounting for this possibility, the author cannot justify the conclusion that a lottery in
Impecunia would be successful.

Finally, the fact that Impecunia's residents spend $50 per capita on gambling each year
lends little support to the argument. Admittedly, this statistic amounts to some evidence of
interest among Impecunla's residents in gambling, and therefore potential interest in a lottery.

However, this evidence in itself does not suffice to prove that the lottery will in fact be popular.

Perhaps Impecunia residents have no more discretionary income to participate in a lottery
after spending $50 on other forms of gambling. Or perhaps Impecunia residents typically travel
elsewhere to gamble as part of their vacations, and that they would not otherwise be interested
in gambling. In short, without more convincing evidence of both an ability and a willingness on
the part of Impecunia's residents to participate in a lottery the author cannot convince me that
the lottery will be profitable.

In conclusion, the editorial has not convinced me that a lottery would be profitable and would
serve to improve Impecunia's education and health programs. To better evaluate the argument
I would need more information comparing Lucria's level of health care and education
expenditures before and after the lottery was established. To strengthen the argument, the
author must provide dear evidence that Lucria's lottery was profitable and that these profits
contributed to improved education and health care in Lucria. The author must also provide
clearer evidence of the willingness and ability of Impecunia residents to participate broadly in a
lottery.
