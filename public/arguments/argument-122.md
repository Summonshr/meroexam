Argument 123
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memo written by a dean at Buckingham College.*

**To serve the housing needs of our students, Buckingham College should build a new
dormitory. Buckingham's enrollment is growing and, based on current trends, should double
over the next fifty years, thus making existing dormitories inadequate. Moreover, the average
rent for an apartment in our town has increased in recent years. Consequently, students will
find it increasingly difficult to afford off-campus housing. Finally, an attractive new dormitory
would make prospective students more likely to enroll at Buckingham.**


In this memo a dean at Buckingham College recommends that in order to meet expected
enrollment increases the college should build an additional dormitory. To support this
recommendation the dean points out that rental rates for off-campus apartments have been
increasing, thus making it more difficult for students to afford this housing option. The dean
also points out that a new dormitory would attract prospective students to the college. This
argument is problematic in several respects.

A threshold problem with the argument involves the statistical reliability of the reports about
off-campus rental rates. The dean indicates only that **student leaders** reported these
statistics; the dean provides no information about how these students collected their data. It is
entirely possible that the report was based on an insufficiently small sample, or a sample that
was unrepresentative of the town's overall student rental market.

Secondly, the dean assumes that this current trend in rental rates will continue in the future;
yet the dean offers no evidence to substantiate this assumption. These rates are a function of
supply and demand, and it is entirely possible that construction of apartment houses will
increase in the future, thereby reducing rental rates along with the need for an additional
dormitory. Without considering this possible scenario, the dean cannot justifiably conclude that
an additional dormitory is needed to meet future demand.

Thirdly, the dean assumes that as enrollment increases the demand for student housing will
also increase. While this might be the case, the dean ignores the possibility that the increased
enrollment will be the result of an increase in the number of students commuting to
Buckingham from their parents' homes. This scenario, if true, would render the dean's
argument for building a new dormitory untenable.

Yet another problem with the argument involves the dean's final claim that an attractive new
dormitory would attract prospective students to Buckingham. Even assuming students in fact
choose colleges on this basis, by relying on this evidence the dean essentially provides an
argument against building the new dormitory. If an attractive new dormitory would increase
demand for dormitory space, this fact would only serve to undermine the dean's conflicting
claim that the new dormitory would help meet increasing demand for dormitory space.

In conclusion, the dean's recommendation is not well supported. To strengthen it the dean
must provide clear evidence that average rental rates for off-campus student apartments have
in fact been increasing, that this trend will continue in the future, and that this trend will in fact
result in an increased demand for dormitory housing.
