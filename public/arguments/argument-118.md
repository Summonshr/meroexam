Argument 118
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memorandum from the general manager of KNOW radio station.*

**Several factors indicate that radio station KNOW should shift its programming from
rock-and-roll music to a continuous news format. Consider, for example, the number of older
people in our listening area has increased dramatically, while the total number of our listeners
has recently declined. Also, music stores in our area report decreased sales of recorded music.

Finally, continuous news stations in neighboring cities have been very successful, and a
survey taken just before the recent election shows that local citizens are interested in
becoming better informed about politics.**


This memo recommends that KNOW radio station shift from rock-and-roll (R&R) music
programming to all-news programming. To support this recommendation the manager points
out that the number of KNOW listeners is decreasing while the number of older people in
KNOW's listening area is increasing. The manager also points out that area sales of music
recordings are in decline, and that a recent survey suggests that local residents are becoming
better informed about politics. Finally, the manager cites the success of aU-news stations in
nearby cities. Careful scrutiny of the manager's argument reveals several unproven
assumptions, which render it unconvincing.

First, the manager unfairly assumes that the decline in the number of KNOW listeners is
attributable to the station's current format. Perhaps the decline is due instead to KNOW's
specific mix of R&R music, or to transmission problems at the station. Without ruling out these
and other feasible reasons for the decline, the manager cannot convince me that changing the
format would reverse the trend.

Secondly, the manager's assumption that older people favor all-news programming is
unsupported. Perhaps KNOW listeners are dedicated R&R fans who will continue to prefer this
type of programming as they grow older. Or perhaps as KNOW's regular audience ages it will
prefer a mix of R&R and news programming--rather than one format to the total exclusion of
the other. Besides, the number of young people in the listening area might be increasing as
well. In short, the mere fact that the number of older people in KNOW's listening area is
increasing suggests nothing about KNOW's best programming strategy.

Thirdly, a decrease in local music recording sales is scant evidence that KNOW should
eschew music in favor of an all-news format. Although overall music sales are in decline,
perhaps sales of R&R recordings are actually increasing while sales of all other types of music
recordings are decreasing. For that matter, perhaps people who buy music recordings are
generally not the same people who listen to music on the radio. Either scenario, if true, would
seriously undermine the manager's contention that KNOW should discontinue R&R
programming.

Fourth, it is unfair to conclude from one survey suggesting that local residents are becoming
better informed about politics that they are becoming less interested in listening to R&R music,
or that they are becoming more interested in listening to news. After all, news embraces many
topics in addition to politics. Besides, there is no reason why people interested in politics
cannot also be interested in listening to R&R music. Moreover, a single survey taken just prior
to an election is poor evidence that local residents' piqued interest in politics is sustainable.

Finally, it is unwarranted to infer from the success of all-news stations in nearby dries that
KNOW will also succeed by following the same format. Those stations might owe their success
to their powerful transmitters, popular newscasters, or other factors. Besides, the very success
of these stations suggests that the area's radio listeners might favor those well-established
news providers over the fledgling all-news KNOW.

In sum, the manager's evidence accomplishes little toward supporting the manager's
argument for the proposed format shift. To further bolster the argument the manager must
provide better evidence, perhaps by way of a reliable survey, that people within KNOW's
listening area are becoming more interested in news and less interested in R&R music--or any
other kind of music. The manager must also show that an all-news format would be more
popular than a mixed format of music and news, and that a significant number of people would
prefer KNOW's all-news programming over that of other stations in the listening area.

Argument No. 119 Solano's music education programs
This letter concludes that Solano school district should discontinue its music programs
altogether. To justify this conclusion the author points out that only 20% of Solano's students
enroll in music classes and that few Solano students pursue music as a major course of study
in college. The author also points out that in nearby Rutherford student grades increased the
year after that district discontinued music education. This argument is problematic in several
critical respects.

A threshold problem with the argument is that it relies on certain implicit assumptions about
the value of music education. Specifically, the author assumes that any education program is
valuable only to the extent that it enhances overall grades and only if students choose to
pursue that course of study in college. Such normative assumptions are dubious at best;
common sense tells me that the chiefvalue of music education, like that of art or physical
education, lies in its contribution to the full development of a child, not in its influence on
grades or choice of career. Without addressing this issue, the author's condusion can be
dismissed out of hand.

Another problem with the argument involves the implicit claim that only 20% of Solano
students enroll in music courses because they are uninterested in music. This da/m assumes
that students have a choice in what courses they take in the first place; yet we are not informed
that this is the case. It also unfairly assumes that no other factor influences students' decisions
about whether to enroll in music courses. Perhaps Solano's current music teachers are
unpopular; or perhaps the district lacks sufficient funds to meet current demand for music
courses or to provide adequate facilities and instruments for more students. Since the author
has not ruled out these other possible explanations for the low enrollment rate, the author's
implicit claim that Solano students are not interested in music is doubtful at best.

Yet another problem with the argument involves the implicit claim that music education is not
worthwhile because few Solano students pursue music as a college major. This claim
assumes that all Solano students pursuing a career in music attend college in the first place;
yet this is not necessarily the case. The claim also assumes that Solano students are properly
advised about choosing their college major; yet it is entirely possible that Solano's high school
advisors dissuade students from pursuing music. Since the author fails to rule out these
possibilities, the fact that few Solano students pursue music in college lends little credible
support for the author's conclusion.

A final problem with the argument involves Rutherford's increase in its students' grades the
year after that district discontinued music programs. This increase might be attributable to
numerous factors. Perhaps that year Rutherford received substantial funding to enhance its
after-school tutoring program; or perhaps it hired more effective teachers that year. Or perhaps
the outgoing graduating class one year was less bright overall than the incoming freshman
class the next year. Any of these scenarios, if true, would discredit the author's assertion that
music education contributes to lower academic grades. Besides, the author cites an increase
during only one year--an insufficiently small range to draw any reliable general conclusion.

In sum, the author's argument for discontinuing music education is weak. To strengthen the
argument the author must show that the cited statistics about Solano students reflect their lack
of interest in music rather than some other phenomenon, and that the increase in Rutherford's
grades were the result of its discontinuing music education.
