Argument 71
---------------------------

**Many employees of major United States corporations are fearful that they will lose their jobs in
the near future, but this fear is largely unfounded. According to a recent study, a majority of
companies expected to make new hires in the coming year, while fewer companies expected
to lay off employees. In addition, although it is very disturbing to be laid off, the proliferation of
programs and of workshops designed to improve job-finding skills has made being laid off far
less painful than it once was.**

The speaker concludes that employees of major U.S. corporations should not fear that they
will lose their jobs in the near future. To support this conclusion the speaker cites the fact that
most companies expect to hire new employees next year, while fewer plan to lay off
employees. The speaker also cites the current proliferation of job-finding resources. The
argument is problematic in several critical respects.

First of all, the argument depends on the assumption that the total number of expected hires
exceeds the total number of expected layoffs. However, we are not informed whether this is
the case. It is possible that, although more companies expect to hire than lay off employees,
the total number of employees expected to be laid off exceeds the total number expected to be
hired. If true, this fact would serve to refute the speaker's condusion that employees of major
U.S. corporations should not expect to be laid off.

Secondly, the argument assumes that the companies that expect to hire next year are major
U.S. corporations. However, it is entirely possible that these are the firms that expect layoffs,
while it is smaller companies that expect to hire. Common sense tells me that this is a
reasonable possibility, because the number of small companies greatly exceeds the number of
large U.S. corporations. Moreover, even ifit is the major U.S. corporations that expect to do
most of the hiring next year, it is entirely possible that it is these same companies that expect
to do most of the laying off. Again, common sense informs me that this is entirely possible--that
these employers intend to replace many current employees or job positions with new ones.

Thirdly, the argument rests on the dubious assumption that all conditions relevant to a
company's decision to hire or lay off employees will remain unchanged in the near future.

While this might be the case, it is equally possible that unexpected changes in general
economic conditions will result in more layoffs among major U.S. corporations next year than
these firms now anticipate.

Finally, the argument seems to rely partly on the proliferation of job-finding programs. While
this fact might allay the worries of employees that they will not find new employment, it is
irrelevant to whether these employees should expect to be laid offin the fist place. In fact, it can
even be argued that the proliferation of job-finding programs is evidence of increasing job
attrition, and therefore evidence of that these employees' fears are well founded.

In condusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the author must
provide clear evidence that the number of expected hires exceeds the number of expected
lay-offs, and that major U.S. corporations are the companies planning to hire rather than to lay
off employees.
