Argument 99
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memorandum from the owner of Armchair Video, a chain of video
rental stores.*

**Because of declining profits, we must reduce operating expenses at Armchair Video's ten
video rental stores. Raising prices is not a good option, since we are famous for our special
bargains. Instead, we should reduce our operating hours. Last month our store in downtown
Marston reduced its hours by closing at 6:00 P.M. rather than 9:00 P.M. and reduced its overall
inventory by no longer stocking any film released more than two years ago. Since we have
received very few customer complaints about these new policies, we should now adopt them
at all other Armchair Video stores as our best strategies for improving profits.**


In this memo the owner of Arrnchair Video concludes that in order to boost sagging profits
Armchair's stores should eliminate evening operating hours and should stock only movies that
are less than two years old. To support this conclusion the owner points out that since
Armchair's downtown Marston store implemented these changes, very few customers have
complained. The owner's argument relies on several unsubstantiated assumptions, and is
therefore unconvincing as it stands.

In the first place, implicit in the argument is the assumption that no other means of boosting
profits is available to Armchair. While the owner has explicitly ruled out the option of raising its
rental rates, the owner ignores other means, such as selling videos, or renting and selling
compact discs, candy, and so forth. Without considering such alternatives, the owner cannot
justifiably conclude that the proposed changes are the only ways Armchair can boost its
profits.

A second problem with the argument is that it assumes that the proposed changes would in
fact enhance profits. It is entirely possible that the lost revenue from reducing store hours
would outweigh the savings in reduced operating costs. Perhaps Armchair customers are
attracted to the stores' wide selection and Variety of movies, and that Armchair would lose their
patronage should it reduce its inventory. Moreover, common sense informs me that video
rental stores do most of their business during evening hours, and therefore that the proposed
action would act~:aily result in a further decline in profits.

Two additional problems involve the downtown Marston store. First, the owner impliciffy
assumes that the store has increased its profits as a result of eliminating evening operating
hours and stocking only newer movies. Yet the owner provides no evidence to support this
assumption. One cannot infer from the mere fact that the store's patrons have not complained
that the store's business, and in turn profits, have increased as a result of these changes.

A second problem with Marston is that the owner assumes this store is representative of
Armchair outlets generally. It is entirely possible that, due to its downtown location, the Marston
store attracts a daytime clientele more interested in new movies, whereas other oudets
depend on an evening clientele with different or more diverse tastes in movies. Or perhaps
downtown Marston lacks competing video stores or movie theaters, whereas Armchair's other
stores are located in areas with many competitors. Without accounting for such possibilities,
the owner cannot convince me that the profits of other Armchair oudets would increase by
following Marston's example.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the owner must
provide strong evidence that the cost savings of the proposed course of action would outweigh
any loss in revenue, and that no other viable means of boosting its profits is available to
Axmchak. To better evaluate the argument we would need information enabling us to compare
the Marston store's clientele and competition with that of other Armchair stores. We would also
need more information about Marston's profitability before and after it implemented the new
policies.
