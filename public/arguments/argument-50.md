Argument 50
---------------------------

**A recent study shows that people living on the continent of North America suffer 9 times more
chronic fatigue and 31 times more chronic depression than do people living on the continent of
Asia. Interestingly, Asians, on average, eat 20 grams of soy per day, whereas North Americans
eat virtually none. It turns out that soy contains phytochemicals called isoflavones, which have
been found to possess disease-preventing properties. Thus, North Americans should consider
eating soy on a regular basis as a way of preventing fatigue and depression.

This argument condudes that North Americans should eat soy on a regular basis as a
means of preventing fatigue and depression. The argument cites a recent study showing that
North Americans suffer far greater from these problems than people in Asia do, that Asians eat
soy regularly whereas North Americans do not, and that soy is known to possess
disease-preventing properties. The argument relies on several doubtful assumptions, and is
therefore unconvincing.

First, the argument assumes that depression and fatigue are just as readily diagnosed in
Asia as in North America. However, it is entirely possible that Asians suffering from these
problems do not complain about them or otherwise admit them. For that matter, perhaps Asian
medical doctors view certain symptoms which North Americans would consider signs of
fatigue and depression as signs of some other problem.

Secondly, the argument assumes that the difference in soy consumption is the only possible
explanation for this disparity in the occurrence of fatigue and depression. Yet the argument
fails to substantiate this assumption. Common sense informs me that any one of a myriad of
other differences---environmental, dietary, and genetic--might explain why North Americans
suffer from these problems to a greater extent than Asians do. Without considering and ruling
out alternative reasons for this disparity, the argument's conclusion that soy is the key to the
disparity is indefensible.

Thirdly, the argument unfairly infers from the fact that soy is known to possess disease
preventing properties that these properties help prevent fatigue and depression specifically.

The argument supplies no evidence to substantiate this assumption. Moreover, whether
fatigue and depression are appropriately classified as diseases in the first place is
questionable.

Finally, even if the properties in soy can be shown to prevent fatigue and depression, the
argument unfairly assumes that eating soy is the only means of ingesting the key substances.

It is entirely possible that these same properties are found in other forms, and therefore that
North Americans need not increase soy consumption to help prevent fatigue and depression.

In sum, the argument is dubious at best. Before I can accept its conclusion, the argument's
proponent must provide better evidence that people in Asia in fact suffer less from fatigue and
depression than North Americans do. To better evaluate the argument I would need to know
what kinds of diseases the properties of soy are known to help prevent, and whether they
relate at all to fatigue and depression. I would also need to know what other foods contain the
same properties as soy--to determine what alternatives, if any, are available for preventing
fatigue and depression.
