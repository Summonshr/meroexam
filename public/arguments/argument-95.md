Argument 95
---------------------------

**The following recommendation was made by the Human Resources Manager to the board of
directors of the Fancy Toy Company. In the last three quarters of this year, under the
leadership of our president, Pat Salvo, our profits have fallen considerably. Thus, we should
ask for her resignation in return for a generous severance package. In Pat's place, we should
appoint Rosa Winnings. Rosa is currently president of Starlight Jewelry, a company whose
profits have increased dramatically over the past several years. Although we will have to pay
Rosa twice the salary that Pat has been receiving, it will be well worth it because we can soon
expect our profits to increase considerably.**


In this memo a manager at Fancy Toy Company recommends replacing Pat Salvo, the
company's current president, with Rosa Winnings, who is currently president of Starlight
Jewelry. To support this recommendation the manager points out that Fancy's profits have
declined during the last three quarters under Pat's leadership, while Starlight's profits have
been increasing dramatically. The manager's argument is unconvincing for several reasons.

First, the manager's recommendation relies partly on the assumption that Pat was the cause
of Fancy Toy's declining profits. However, this need not be the case. Perhaps the toy business
is seasonal, and the coming quarter is always the most profitable one. Or perhaps the cost of
materials or labor have increased, and Pat has had no control over these increases. Without
taking into account such possibilities, the manager simply cannot reasonably conclude that Pat
is responsible for Fancy's declining profits, and that replacing Pat will therefore enhance
Fancy's profits.

Similarly, the manager's recommendation assumes that it is Rosa who has been primarily
responsible for Starlight's profitability. However, the manager provides no evidence to affirm
this assumption. It is entirely possible that all jewelry businesses have prospered recently,
regardless of the abilities of the managers. Or perhaps the costs of precious metals and other
materials have declined in recent years, thereby leading to increased profits for Starlight.

Moreover, perhaps Rosa has only served as president of Starlight for a short while, and it was
her predecessor who is to credit for Starlight's profitability. Without taking into account these
possibilities, the manager cannot defend the conclusion that it is Rosa who is responsible for
Starlight's increasing profitability.

Finally, the manager's recommendation to replace Pat with Rosa rests on the poor
assumption that the two businesses are sufficiently similar that Rosa's experience and skill in
one business will transfer to the other. Even if Starlight's increasing profitability is attributable to
Rosa's leadership, she might nevertheless be unsuccessful leading a toy company, depending
on how much experience in the toy business is required to successfully lead such a company.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the manager must
show that Pat, and not some other factor beyond Pat's control, is responsible for Fancy's
declining profits. Similarly, the manager must show that it is Rosa who is primarily responsible
for Starlight's profitability, and that Rosa's abilities will transfer to the toy business. In order to
better evaluate the argument, we would need more information about how long Pat and Rosa
have served as presidents of their respective companies, and what their long-term record is for
leading their respective companies to profitability.
