Argument 81
---------------------------

**The Department of Education in the state of Attra recommends that high school students be
assigned homework every day. Yet a recent statewide survey of high school math and science
teachers calls the usefulness of daily homework into question. In the district of Sanlee, 86
percent of the teachers reported assigning homework three to five times a week, whereas in
the district of Marlee, less than 25 percent of the teachers reported assigning homework three
to five times a week. Yet the students in Marlee earn better grades overall and are less likely to
be required to repeat a year of school than are the students in Sanlee. Therefore, all teachers
in our high schools should assign homework no more than twice a week, if at all.**

The speaker argues that if the state board of education required that homework be assigned
to high school students no more than twice per week academic performance would improve.

To support this assertion the speaker cites a statewide survey of math and science teachers.

According to the survey, students in the Mafiee district, who are assigned homework no more
than once per week, achieve better grades and are less likely to repeat a school year than
students in the Sanlee district, who are assigned homework every night. Close scrutiny reveals,
however, that this evidence provides little credible support for the speaker's assertion.

To begin with, the survey appears to suffer from two statistical problems, either of which
renders the survey's results unreliable. First, the speaker relies on statistics from only two
districts; however, it is entirely possible that these two districts are not representative of the
state's school districts overall. Second, the survey involved only math and science teachers.

Yet the speaker draws a broad recommendation for all teachers based on the survey's results.

In addition, the speaker's recommendation relies on the assumption that the amount of
homework assigned to students is the only possible reason for the comparative academic
performance between students in the two districts. However, in all likelihood this is simply not
the case. Perhaps Sanlee teachers are stricter graders then Marlee teachers. Or perhaps
Sanlee teachers are less effective than Marlee teachers, and therefore Sanlee students would
perform more poorly regardless of homework schedule. Or perhaps fewer Sanlee students
than Marlee students actually do their assigned homework. In short, in order to properly
conclude that fewer homework assignments results in better academic performance, the
speaker must first rule out all other feasible explanations for the disparity in academic
performance between the two districts.

Finally, the survey results as reported by the speaker are too vague to support any firm
conclusion. The speaker reports that Sanlee students receive lower grades and are more likely
to repeat a school year then Marlee students. Yet the speaker does not indicate whether this
fact applies to Sanlee and Marlee students generally, or just to math and science students.

The speaker's recommendation for all high school students might be defensible in the former
case, but not in the latter case.

In conclusion, the recommendation that all high school students be assigned homework
once per week at most is indefensible based on the evidence. To strengthen the argument, the
speaker must show that the reported correlation in the areas of math and science is also found
among most other academic subjects. The speaker must also rule out other factors that might
determine the students' grades and their likelihood of repeating a year. Finally, to better assess
the argument we would need to know whether the reported disparity in academic performance
between Sanlee and Marlee students involved only math and science students or all students.
