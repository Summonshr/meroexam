Argument 60
---------------------------

**The Mozart School of Music should obviously be the first choice of any music student aware of
its reputation. First of all, the Mozart School stresses intensive practice and training, so that
students typically begin their training at a very young age. Second, the school has ample
facilities and up-to-date professional equipment, and its faculty includes some of the most
distinguished music teachers in the world. Finally, many Mozart graduates have gone on to be
the best known and most highly paid musicians in the nation.**

This argument concludes that the Mozart School should be the first choice of any music
student aware of its reputation for
* its intensive practice requirements for students of all
ages,
* its outstanding facilities, up-to-date equipment, and distinguished faculty, and
* the
accomplishments of its graduates. Although the evidence provided strongly suggests that this
school would be an excellent choice for certain prospective students, the conclusion that it
should be the first choice for any prospective music student is indefensible in three respects.

First, the fact that the Mozart School is known for its intensive practice and training regimen
for even the youngest students suggests that the school might be suitable for certain child
proteges, but perhaps not for children for whom a more balanced education would be more
prudent. For that matter, many older students with other interests and activities would no doubt
find the intensity and time commitment that the Mozart program requires unfeasible or
undesirable.

Secondly, in all likelihood the outstanding facilities, equipment, and faculty come at a
considerable price to students--m the form of high tuition. Thus the argument seems to
assume that for all prospective music students money is no object when it comes to musical
training. Yet common sense informs me that many students would place a higher priority on
affordable training than on the specific features that the argument touts.

Thirdly, although the fact that many famous performers and highly-paid performers are
among the school's graduates might be relevant to students with the requisite natural talent
and motivation to attain these lofty goals, for others this feature would not be relevant. For
example, some prospective students would no doubt wish to focus their study on musicology,
theory, composition, or even performance--not to become famous or highly-paid performers
but rather to prepare for careers in music education. Other prospective students might not
aspire to make music their eventual vocation at all. Thus some other school--one with a less
rigorous performance-oriented approach--might be a better choice for less-gifted students and
for those with other aspirations.

In sum, the Mozart School's features do not justify the argument's sweeping conclusion that
the school should be the first choice for every music student. To strengthen the argument, its
proponent must show at the very least that the school would be affordable to any prospective
student. To better assess the argument I would need more information about what
non-performance music programs the school offers, and whether Mozart students of various
ages have any choice in how intensely they are required to practice and train.
