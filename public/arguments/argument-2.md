Argument 2
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a letter sent by a committee of homeowners from the Deerhaven
Acres to all homeowners in Deerhaven Acres.*

**Seven years ago, homeowners in nearby Brookville community adopted a set of restrictions
on how the community's yards should be landscaped and what colors the exteriors of homes
should be painted. Since then, average property values have tripled in Brookville. In order to
raise property values in Deerhaven Acres, we should adopt our own set of restrictions on
landscaping and housepainting.**


In this letter a committee of Deerhaven Acres homeowners recommends that in order to
enhance Deerhaven property values homeowners should follow certain restrictions conceming
their homes' exterior appearance. To support this recommendation the committee points out
that in the seven years since Brookwille adopted similar restrictions property values there have
risen. This argument rests on a series of unsubstantiated assumptions, and is therefore
unpersuasive as it stands.

A threshold assumption upon which the recommendation relies is that BrookviUe home
owners implemented Brookville's restrictions in the first place. The letter fails to substantiate
this crucial assumption. If these restrictions were not implemented, then any change in
Brookville's property values cannot be attributed to them. Accordingly, the committee cannot
draw any firm conclusion about what effect similar restrictions would have on Deerhaven
property values.

Even assuming that BrookviUe homeowners implemented these restrictions, the committee
relies on the additional assumption that this course of action was responsible for the increase
in BrookwiUe property values. However, it is entirely possible that one or more other factors
were instead responsible for the increase, especially since a considerable period of time has
passed since Brookville adopted its restrictions. Property values are a function of supply and
demand. Perhaps the demand for housing in the area has increased due to an influx of major
employers. Or, perhaps the supply of housing has decreased. Either scenario would provide
an alternative explanation for the increase in property values.

Even assuming that BrookviUe's rising property values are attributable to the
implementation of these restrictions, the committee fails to consider possible differences
between BrookviUe and Deerhaven that might help to bring about a different result for Deer
haven. For instance, potential Deerhaven home-buyers might be less interested in a home's
exterior appearance than BrookviUe home-bwers. For that matter, perhaps Deerhaven
home-buyers would find consistent exterior appearance a distasteful feature in which case
adopting these restrictions might actually tend to decrease Deer-haven property values.

Without accounting for these and other possible dissimilarities, the committee cannot assume
that what resulted in rising property values in Brookville would bring about the same result in
Deerhaven.

In conclusion, to persuade me that Deerhaven should adopt the proposed restrictions the
committee must supply clear evidence that the implementation of Brookville's restrictions, and
not some other factor, was responsible for the rise in Brookville's property values. The
committee must also provide evidence that other factors affecting home prices in the two areas
are otherwise essentially the same.
