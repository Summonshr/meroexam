Argument 88
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a newspaper feature story.*

**At the small, nonprofit hospital in the town of Saluda, the average length of a patient's stay is
two days; at the large, for-profit hospital in the nearby city of Megaville, the average patient
stay is six days. Also, the cure rate among patients in the Saluda hospital is about twice that of
the Megaville hospital. The Saluda hospital has more employees per patient than the hospital
in Megaville, and there are few complaints about service at the local hospital. Such data
indicate that treatment in smaller, nonprofit hospitals is more economical and of better quality
than treatment in larger, for-profit hospitals.**


This newspaper story concludes that the small, nonprofit hospital in Saluda provides more
efficient, better-quality care than the for-profit hospital in Megaville. To justify this conclusion
the author cites the following comparisons between the Saluda hospital and the Megaville
hospital: At the Saluda hospital the average length of a patient's stay is shorter, the cure rate
and employee-patient ratio are both higher, and the number of complaints from patients is
lower. However, careful consideration of these facts reveals that they fail to justify the author's
conclusion.

In the first place, the author unfairly assumes that a shorter hospital stay indicates a quicker
recovery and therefore better care. It is equally possible that the Saluda hospital simply cannot
afford to keep patients as long as it should to ensure proper care and recovery. Perhaps the
hospital sends patients home prematurely for the purpose of freeing up beds for other patients.

Since the author has failed to rule out other possible explanations for this shorter average stay,
I remain unconvinced based on this evidence that the Saluda hospital provides better care
than Megaville's hospital.

In the second place, the mere fact that the rate of cure at the Saluda hospital is higher than
at MegaviUe's hospital proves nothing about the quality of care at either hospital. It is entirely
possible that more Saluda patients suffer from curable problems than Megaville patients do.

Without considering this possibility the author cannot justifiably rely on curerates to draw any
conclusions about comparative quality of care.

In the third place, a higher employee-patient ratio at Saluda is weak evidence of either better
care or greater efficiency. Common sense informs me that it is the competence of each
employee, not the number of employees, that determines overall q, ality of care. Besides, it is
entirely possible that the comparatively large staff at Saluda is the result of organizational
inefficiency, and that a smaller staff of more effective, better managed people would provide
better care.

Finally, the mere fact that the Saluda hospital receives fewer patient complaints than
MegaviUe's hospital proves nothing about either efficiency or quality of care. Even though the
number of complaints is smaller, the percentage of patients complaining might be higher. Also,
MegaviUe's staff might openly encourage patient feedback while Saluda's does not. This
scenario accords with my observation that for-profit organizations are generally more
concerned with customer satisfaction than non-profit organizations are.

In sum, the facts that the story cites amount to weak evidence that the Saluda hospital
provides more efficient, better-quality care than Megaville's hospital. To strengthen the
argument, the author must provide dear evidence that at the Saluda hospital patients are
released earlier because they have received better care--rather than for some other reason. To
better assess the argument, I would need to compare the percentage of MegaviUe's hospital
patients who suffer from curable problems with the percentage of Saluda patients who suffer
from similar problems. Also, I would need more information from each hospital about complaint
procedures and the percentage of patients who lodge complaints.
