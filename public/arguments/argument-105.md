Argument 105
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memorandum from a vice president of the Megamart department
store chain.*

**For the third year in a row, the average household income in our country has risen significantly.

That prosperity means that families are likely to be spending more time and money on leisure
activities. Megamart stores should therefore concentrate on enlarging and promoting its line of
products typically used in leisure activities: athletic and outdoor equipment, televisions,
gourmet cooking equipment, and luggage and travel accessories.**


In this memo the vice president of Megamart concludes that Megamart should expand its
line of products related to leisure activities. To support this claim the memo points out that for
three years in a row the average household income nationwide has risen. However, close
inspection of the argument reveals several logical problems, which render it unconvincing as it
stands.

First of all, the claim relies on two threshold assumptions about rising income. One is that
this trend will continue in the future; if it does not then the proposed course of action is unlikely
to result in increased profits for Megamart. The other threshold assumption is that the cost of
living is not also increasing at least at a commensurate rate. Yet it is entirely possible that living
costs have risen to meet or even exceed the rise in income.

If so, Megamart would in all likelihood sell fewer leisure products than otherwise. Even
assuming that discretionary income is rising and will continue to rise, the argument relies on
the additional assumption that people will spend this discretionary income on leisure products.

However, the memo provides no evidence to substantiate this assumption. Perhaps people
are increasing their savings rather than spending their additional income. If so, this fact would
significantly undermine the vice president's claim that demand for leisure products is
increasing, and therefore that Megamart would benefit by offering more such products.

Yet another problem with the argument involves the reason why average income has risen in
the first place. It is entirely possible that income has risen because people have been working
more hours. If so, then in all likelihood people have less leisure time, in which case they will not
spend more money on leisure products--simply because they have less time for leisure
pursuits. Without addressing this issue, the vice president cannot convince me that Megamart
should expand itsline of leisure products.

In conclusion, the vice president's argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the
vice president must provide strong evidence that discretionary income is rising and will
continue to rise. The vice president must also show that people will in fact choose to spend this
income on leisure products, and that people have enough free time for leisure pursuits in the
first place.
