Argument 75
---------------------------

*The following appeared as part of an article in a health magazine.*

**A new discovery warrants a drastic change in the diets of people living in the United States.

Two scientists have recently suggested that omega -3 fatty acids (found in some fish and fish
oils) play a key role in mental health. Our ancestors, who ate less saturated fat and more
polyunsaturated fat, including omega -3 fatty acids, were much less likely to suffer from
depression than we are today. Moreover, modern societies---such as those in Japan and
Taiwan---that consume large quantities of fish report depression rates lower than that in the
United States. Given this link between omega -3 fatty acids and depression, it is important for
all people in the United States to increase their consumption of fish in order to prevent
depression.**


The author of this article asserts that people who live in the U.S. should increase their fish
consumption in order to prevent depression. To support this assertion, the author cites the fact
that our ancestors, who were less likely to experience depression than we are today,
consumed more omega-3 fatty acids, which help prevent depression and are found in some
fish and fish oils. The author also cites the fact that in modern societies where people eat more
fish than we do the reported incidence of depression is comparatively iow. However, the
author's reasoning is problematic in several critical respects.

The first problem with the argument involves the comparatively low incidence of depression
among our ancestors. The author assumes that no factor other than the ingestion of omega-3
is responsible for this lower incidence. However, it is entirely possible that environmental or
other dietary factors are instead responsible for the lower incidence. For example, perhaps
other substances common in the U.S. diet today, and which promote depression, were not part
of our ancestors' diets.

Another problem with the argument involves the low incidence of depression reported
among today's fish-eating societies. To reasonably infer a causal relationship between
fish-eating and low rates of depression in these societies, two assumptions are required. The
first is that the types of fish consumed in these societies in fact contain omega-3; however the
artide provides no evidence that this is the case. The second assumption is that the reported
incidence of depression accurately reflects the actual incidence. However, it is entirely
possible that in those societies people generally do not report depression.

A third problem with the argument is that it assumes that omega-3 is only available in fish.

However, the author provides no evidence to substantiate this crucial assumption. Perhaps
people can ingest omega-3 by taking fish oil capsules rather than eating fish. Or perhaps
omega-3 is also found in other foods as well. In either case, the author cannot reasonably
conclude that we must eat more fish to ingest omega-3 and thereby help prevent depression.

Finally, in concluding that people in the U.S. must ingest more omega-3 to prevent
depression, the author infers that this is the only means of prevenl~ag depression. This
reasoning is fallacious. There might be a myriad of alternative ways to prevent depression;
moreover, experience and common sense informs me that this is indeed the case.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it, the author must
provide clear evidence that no other factors explain the comparatively low incidence of
depression among our ancestors. The author must also show that in modem fish-eating
societies people in fact ingest more omega-3 than people in the U.S. do, and that the
incidence of depression is in fact lower in those societies. To better evaluate the argument, we
would need more information about alternative methods of preventing depression and
alternative sources of omega-3.
