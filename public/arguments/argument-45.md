Argument 45
---------------------------

*The following is a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.*

**As a local merchant, I wish to support the development of a ski resort in the state park north of
our township. Along with many other merchants who favor the proposal by Ski the Slopes,
Incorporated, I would, of course, experience a growth in my business. But I also know how
much more prosperous, not to mention lively and interesting, our community would be if
tourism increased. Since the main opposition comes from a few environmentalists* who do not
even live in this community, I see no reason to give in to their views. The First National Bank
has finally researched the project and agreed to fund it. As a result, I see no reason to delay
development of the resort.**


*Environmentalists are people who advocate the preservation of the natural environment.

This editorial concludes that a new ski resort should be developed north of town because it
would attract tourism and therefore be an economic boon to local merchants. To support this
claim the author, a local merchant, points out that those opposed to the project do not live in
the area and that a bank has agreed to fund the project. The argument suffers from several
critical flaws and is therefore unpersuasive as it stands.

First of all, that mere fact that environmentalists who oppose the development do not live in
the town lends no credible support to the editorial’s conclusion. In essence the author attemps
to argue for one position by attacking his opponents based on potentially irrelevant
considerations. We are not informed about the enviromentalists’ specific reasons for their
position. Besides, although they do not live in the town they might operate business or own
property in the area; thus, their opposition might be based on economic grounds entirely
relevant to the argument.

Secondly, the editoral provides no firm evidence to justify the assertion that a new ski resort
north of town will in fact benefit the town’s merchants. It is entirely possible that the resort
might have the opposite effect, by drawing business away from local merchants, especially if
the resort includes facilities such as apparel shops, restaurants, and grocery stores. Besides,
we are not in informed how far from town the resort would be located or how tourists would
reach the resort. It is possible, for example, that the resort would be situated where visitors
would take a route that does not pass through the town. Without ruling out these possibilities
the editorial cannot justify its assertion that the resort would be a boon for local merchants.

Thirdly, the editoral’s conclusion relies partly on the fact that a bank has agreed to fund the
resort’s development. However, this fact alone does not lend support to the assertion that local
merchants will benefit. Common sense tells me that the bank agreed to fund the project
because it believes the resort will be profitable, not because it believes other local merchants
will benefit. In fact, a profitable ski resort might very well draw business away from local
merchants.

In conclusion, the argument is untenable as it stands. To strengthen it, the editorial’s author
must provide clear evidence that the resort would increase business for the town’s merchants
rather than drawing business away from these merchants. To better evaluate the argument,
we would need more information about the bank’s reasons for agreeing to fund the project –
especially whether the bank also lends to existing local merchants whose interests would be
affected by the resort.
