Argument 55
---------------------------

**A folk remedy* for insomnia, the scent in lavender flowers, has now been proved effective. In a
recent study, 30 volunteers with chronic insomnia slept each night for three weeks on
lavender-scented pillows in a controlled room where their sleep was monitored. During the first
week, volunteers continued to take their usual sleeping medication. They slept soundly but
wakened feeling tired. During the second week, the volunteers discontinued their medication.**

**As a result, they slept less soundly than the previous week and felt even more tired. During the
third week, the volunteers slept longer and more soundly than in the previous two weeks. This
shows that over a short period of time lavender cures insomnia.**

**A folk remedy is usually a plant-based form of treatment common to traditional forms of
medicine, ones that developed before the advent of modern medical services and technology.**

The speaker concludes that the scent of lavender provides an effective short-term cure for
insomnia. To support this conclusion the speaker cites a three-week experiment in which
researchers monitored the apparent effects of lavender on 30 insomniacs, who slept on
lavender-scented pillows each night of the experiment. The speaker's account of the
experiment reveals several critical problems with it. Together, these problems serve to
undermine the speaker's argument.

A threshold problem involves the definition of insomnia. The speaker fails to define this
critical term. Ifinsomnia is defined as an inability to fall asleep, then how soundly or long a
person sleeps, or how fired a person feels after sleep, is irrelevant to whether the person
suffers from insomnia. In short, without a dear definition of insomnia it is impossible to assess
the strength of the argument.

Another fundamental problem is that the speaker omits to inform us about the test subjects'
sleep patterns just prior to the experiment. It is impossible to conclude with any confidence that
the subjects benefited from sleeping on lavender-scented pillows without comparing how they
slept with the pillows to how they sleep without them.

Yet another problem involves the fact that subjects slept more soundly and awakened less
fired the first week than the second, and that they used their regular sleep medication the first
week but not the second. This evidence tends to show only that the subjects' other sleep
medications were effective; it proves nothing about the effectiveness of lavender.

A fourth problem involves the speaker's account of the experiment's third week, during
which the speaker reports only that the subjects slept longer and more soundly than in the
previous two weeks. We are not informed whether the subjects took any medication during the
third week. Assuming they did not, any one of a variety of factors other than the
lavender-scented pillows might explain the third week's results. Perhaps the subjects were
simply making up for sleep they lost the previous week when they discontinued their regular
medication. Or perhaps the subjects were finally becoming accustomed to the
lavender-scented pillows, which actually disturbed sleep initially. In short, without ruling out
other explanations for the third week's results, the speaker cannot confidently identify what
caused the subjects to sleep longer and more soundly that week.

Two final problems with the argument involve the experimental process. The experiment's
results are reliable only if all other factors that might affect sleep patterns remained constant
during the three-week period, and if the number of experimental subjects is statistically
significant. Without evidence of the experiment's methodological and statistical reliability, the
speaker's conclusion is unjustifiable.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen the assertion that
lavender-scented pillows provide a short-term cure for insomnia, the author must provide
evidence that the test subjects' insomnia was worse just prior to the experiment than at the
conclusion of the experiment, and that the number of subjects is statistically sufficient to
warrant the conclusion. To better assess the argument, we would need a clear definition of
insomnia, as well as more information about whether the researchers conducted the
experiment in a controlled environment.
