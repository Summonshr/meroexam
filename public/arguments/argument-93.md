Argument 93
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memorandum from the planning department of an electric power
company.*

**Several recent surveys indicate that homeowners are increasingly eager to conserve energy
and manufacturers are now marketing many home appliances, such as refrigerators and air
conditioners, that are almost twice as energy-efficient as those sold a decade ago. Also, new
technologies for better home insulation and passive solar heating are readily available to
reduce the energy needed for home heating. Therefore, we anticipate that the total demand for
electricity in our area will not increase, and may decline slightly. Since our three electric
generating plants in operation for the past 20 years have always met our needs, construction
of new generating plants should not be necessary.**


The author of this memo concludes that there is no need for an additional electric power
plant in the area because total electricity demand in the area is not likely to increase in the
future. To support this conclusion the author cites the availability of new energy-efficient
appliances and systems for homes, and the eagerness of area homeowners to conserve
energy. However, the argument relies on several doubtful assumptions, and is therefore
unpersuasive as it stands.

First, the author's projection for flat or declining total demand for electricity ignores business
and commercial electricity usage. It is entirely possible that area businesses will increase their
use of electricity in the future and that total electricity consumption will actually increase
despite flat or declining residential demand. The author's projection also ignores the possibility
that the number of area residents will increase in the future, thereby resulting in an increase in
electricity usage regardless of whether more efficient appliances are used in area homes.

Without taking into account these possibilities, the author cannot persuade me that total
demand for electricity will not increase in the future.

Secondly, the author's conclusion relies on the assumption that area residents will actually
purchase and install the energy-saving appliances and systems the author describes.

Admittedly, the author points out that homeowners are **eager to conserve energy.**


Nevertheless, these homeowners might not be able to afford these new systems and
appliances. Moreover, the energy-efficient insulation that the author mentions might be
available only for new home construction, or it might be a gas system. In either case, the mere
availability of this system might have no effect on total electric usage in existing homes.

A final problem involves the assertion that no new electric power plants are needed because
the three existing plants, which are 20 years old, have always been adequate for the area's
electric needs. The author fails to account for the possibility that the old plants are themselves
less energy efficient than a new plant using new technology would be, or that the old plants
need to be replaced due to their age, or for some other reason. Besides, this assertion ignores
the possible influx of residents or businesses in the future, thereby increasing the demand for
electricity beyond what the three existing plants can meet.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the author must
show that area residents can afford the new energy-efficient appliances and systems, and that
area commercial demand for electricity will not increase significantly in the foreseeable future.

In order to better evaluate the argument, we would need to know whether the new
energy-efficient technologies are available to businesses as well, and whether area
businesses plan to use them. We would also need more information about expected changes
in the area's population, and about the condition and energy-efficiency of the three current
electric power plants.
