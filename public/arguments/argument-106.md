Argument 106
---------------------------

*The following appeared in an article in a magazine for writers.*

**A recent study showed that in describing a typical day's conversation, people make an
average of 23 references to watching television and only 1 reference to reading fiction. This
result suggests that, compared with the television industry, the publishing and bookselling
industries are likely to decline in profitability. Therefore, people who wish to have careers as
writers should acquire training and experience in writing for television rather than for print
media.**


This article cites a recent study showing that during a typical day people make an average of
23 references to watching television but only one reference to reading fiction. From these
statistics the author reasons that the television industry must be far more profitable than the
book-publishing industry, then concludes that people seeking careers in writing should acquire
training and experience in television writing. This argument is flawed in several critical
respects.

First of all, the article's author has not shown the study upon which the argument depends to
be statistically reliable. The people studied must be representative of the overall population of
people who buy books and watch television; otherwise the author cannot draw any firm
conclusions about the comparative profitability of the television and book publishing industries
based on the study's results.

Secondly, the author's argument depends on the assumption that the frequency with which a
person refers in conversation to television, or to fiction books, is a good indication of how much
television a person watches, or how many fiction books a person reads. Yet this is not
necessarily the case. Perhaps people tend to refer many times in daily conversation to the
same television show. If so, then the statistics cited would overstate the amount of television
people watch compared to the number of fiction books they read.

Thirdly, even if the statistics cited accurately reflect the amount of television people watch
compared to the number of fiction books they read, it would be hasty to infer based merely on
this fact that the television industry is more profitable than the book-publishing industry. To
begin with, the study's results excluded any data about nonfiction books--a category that might
very well constitute book publishers' main profit source. Moreover, the author has not shown
any correlation, let alone a cause-and-effect relationship, between the number of hours a
person spends watching television and that industry's profits. In any event, lacking financial
statistics about the profitability of the two industries the editorial's author cannot convince me
that writers should follow the author's recommendation.

Finally, even assuming that the television industry is more profitable than the
book-publishing industry, the author's implicit claim that television writers enjoy more secure
and lucrative careers than book writers is without support. It is entirely possible that television
writers are paid comparatively low wages; in fact, low writer compensation might partially
explain why the television industry is relatively profitable. Without better evidence that
television writers are better off then book writers it might be folly to follow the author's
recommendation.

In sum, the argument relies on several poor assumptions and is therefore unconvincing as it
stands. To strengthen it the article's author must provide dear evidence that the study's
subjects reflect the overall population, and that their conversational habits accu rately reflect
how much television they watch compared to how many books they read. The author must
also show that the disparity between the two contributes to far greater financial rewards for the
television industry, as well as for its writers, than for the book publishing industry and its
writers.
