Argument 74
---------------------------

*The following is a recommendation from the director of personnel to the president of
Professional Printing Company.*

**In a recent telephone survey of automobile factory workers, older employees were less likely
to report that having a supervisor present increases their productivity. Among workers aged 18
to 29, 27 percent said that they are more productive in the presence of their immediate
supervisor, compared to 12 percent for those aged 30 or over, and only 8 percent for those
aged 50 or over. Clearly, if our printing company hires mainly older employees, we will
increase productivity and save money because of the reduced need for supervisors.**


In this argument the personnel director of Professional Printing Company (PPC)
recommends hiring older workers in order to increase productivity, as well as to save money by
reducing costs of supervision. To support this recommendation, the director cites an
auto-industry telephone survey ostensibly showing that older workers are generally less
productive under close supervision than otherwise, whereas younger workers are generally
more productive under close supervision than otherwise. This argument is flawed in several
critical respects.

A threshold problem with the argument involves the statistical reliability of the survey. The
director provides no evidence that the number of respondents is statistically significant or that
the respondents were representative of auto workers in general. Lacking information about the
randomness and size of the survey's sample, the director cannc;to make a convincing
argument based on that survey.

Even if the survey's respondents are representative of the entire population of auto workers,
the argument relies on the assumption that the responses themselves are reliable. Yet the
director ignores the possibility that a young, inexperienced worker is less likely to be forthright
about the value of supervision--for fear of retaliation by that supervisor. For that matter,
younger workers might not have enough experience working without supervision to determine
when they are most productive. Lacking evidence that the respondents' reports were both
truthful and meaningful, the director cannot confidently draw and conclusions about worker
productivity from them.

Even assuming that the survey data accurately reflect the auto industry, the argument
unfairly assumes that supervision affects worker productivity similarly at PPC. Perhaps PPC
employs certain unique equipment or processes that require close worker supervision--even
for older, more experienced workers. For that matter, perhaps youth or inexperience is an
advantage in working productively at PPC, whereas in the auto industry either is a
disadvantage. In short, without accounting for possible differences between PPC and auto
manufacturers the director cannot convince me that his recommendation for PPC is sound.

The argument also assumes that older people are more experienced, and thus less likely to
benefit from supervision, than younger people. Although this assumption might gen erally be
sound, it nevertheless might not hold true for workers at PPC specifically. In other words,
despite their age many younger PPC worker might be more experienced at their jobs, and
therefore more productive without supervision, than many older PPC workers.

Finally, even if hiring older workers will reduce the need for supervision, the director
concludes too hastily that PPC will save money as a result. It is possible that older workers
command a higher wage than younger workers do. If so, these higher wages might offset
production gains and payroll savings accruing from reduced supervision.

In sum, the survey's statistical reliability and its relevance to PPC is questionable. To
strengthen the recommendation the director must provide clear evidence that in the printing
industry, and especially at PPC, older workers are more experienced or otherwise can work
more productively without supervision than younger workers. To better assess the argument, I
would need a detailed cost-benefit analysis that accounts not only for gains in productivity but
also for the possible impact of hiring only older workers on total payroll costs.
