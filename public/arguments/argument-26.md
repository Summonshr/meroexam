Argument 26
---------------------------

*The following is a memo from the superintendent of the Mylar school district.*

**A recent six-month study, in which breakfast was made available at school for 100
schoolchildren ages five to twelve, found that children on the breakfast plan were less likely
than other children to be absent from or late for school. Clearly, eating breakfast before school
plays a role in reducing student absenteeism and tardiness. It is also well known that children
who regularly eat a healthful breakfast tend to perform better in school. Therefore, in order to
reduce absenteeism and tardiness and to improve academic performance in all of Mylar's
elementary and secondary schools, we should provide breakfasts for all students before each
school day.**


In this memo the superintendent of the Mylar school district concludes that by providing
breakfast to all its students the district would reduce tardiness and absenteeism as well as
improve the overall academic performance of its students. To support this conclusion the
superintendent points out that during a 6-month trial program involving 100 students ranging in
age from 5 to 12, these students were less likely to be tardy or absent than other students. The
superintendent also cites the well-known fact that eating healthful breakfasts on a regular
basis improves academic performance. The superintendent's argument is problematic in
several respects, rendering the argument unconvincing as it stands.

The argument's chief problem is that it relies on numerous unsubstantiated assumptions
about the 6-month study. One such assumption is that the participants' regular and punctual
attendance was attributable to the fact that breakfasts were provided. Yet logic and common
sense inform me that the results might have been due instead to one or more other factors.

Perhaps these particular students were compelled to show up punctually and regularly for
some other reason. Perhaps the 100 participants were comparatively reliable and disciplined
children who are less likely in any event to be late for school. Or perhaps the participants are
relatively healthy and therefore less likely to be absent from school than the average student.

Moreover, it is uncertain whether the program's participants even ate the breakfasts that the
trial program provided. In short, without considering and ruling out alternative explanations for
the study's results, the superintendent cannot justifiably conclude that the results are due to
the fact that breakfasts were provided to participating students.

Even if the participants' punctual and regular attendance was due to the breakfasts provided
to them, the statistical reliability of the trial program's results is questionable. The number of
participants, 100, might constitute an insufficiently small sample to draw any reliable
conclusions about how district students 5-12 years of age would behave under similar
conditions---as a group. The larger this group compared to the sample of 100 participants, the
less reliable the study's results. Also, the sample might be unrepresentative of district students
as a group. For example, perhaps the 100 participants happened to be children who eat small
dinners and are therefore hungry for breakfast.

Even if the 100 participants are statistically representative of district students 5-12 years of
age, one cannot infer that older, secondary-school students would behave similarly under
similar conditions. Yet by concluding that the district should implement the program for its
secondary-school students as well, the superintendent seems to assume without supporting
evidence that this is the case. In short, lacking assurances that the 100 participants are
statistically representative of all district students, the superintendent can not draw any reliable
conclusions based on the study.

Aside from the problems involving the 6-month study, the superintendent's conclusion that
the overall academic performance of district students would improve under the proposed
program is unwarranted. By relying on the fact that eating healthful breakfasts on a regular
basis improves academic performance, the superintendent assumes that the district's
breakfasts would be healthful and that students would eat them on a regular basis.

Yet no evidence is offered to substantiate these crucial assumptions. It is entirely possible
that the district's breakfasts would not be sufficiently healthful, or that district students would
not eat these breakfasts regularly. In fact, the superintendent has not shown either that the trial
program's participants or that the broader population of district students would eat healthful
breakfasts, or any breakfast at all, under any circumstances.

In conclusion, the superintendent's argument is specious. To bolster it she must provide
clear evidence that the 100 participants in the trial program actually attended school regularly
and punctually because of the breakfasts provided, and that these 100 students are
statistically representative not only of other 5-12 year-olds but of older students as well--as a
group. Finally, to better evaluate the daim that the program would improve academic
performance I would need more information about the healthfulness of the breakfasts provided
under the proposed program.
