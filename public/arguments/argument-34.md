Argument 34
---------------------------

*The following appeared in the editorial section of a local newspaper.*

**The librarians in our town's school system have reported that the number of trips that our
students make to their school library on a voluntary basis has decreased significantly in recent
years. For example, the average seventh-grade student visited the school library five times
last year, but four of those visits were part of required classroom activities. This shows that our
students are reading less than in the past. To address this problem, our town needs to improve
the atmosphere of the libraries so that they will be comfortable places in which to work. If
students view the libraries as uncomfortable, then they are unlikely to want to spend much time
there.**


In this editorial the author claims that the town's students are reading less, and that by
improving the atmosphere in the town's school libraries students would visit their school library
more frequently and, in turn, would read more. To support these claims the author points out
that the number of annual visits students make to their school library, on average, has
decreased significantly in recent years. Specifically, the average seventh grader paid five such
visits last year, four of which were required for classes. Close inspection of the evidence
reveals, however, that it lends little credible support for the proposed course of action.

First, the author unfairly assumes that since the number of library visits per student is
declining the amount of reading on the part of students must also be declining. This poor
assumption overlooks the possibility that students are doing more reading or checking out
more reading materials during each library visit. It also ignores the possibility that more and
more students are obtaining reading material elsewhere--for example, from public libraries or
from the Internet. Without considering and ruling out these possibilities, the author cannot
justifiably conclude that students are reading less merely because they are visiting their school
library less often.

Secondly, the author assumes that the reason for the declining number of library visits is that
the library is uncomfortable. Yet, the author offers no evidence to substantiate this assumption.

Lacking such evidence, a variety of other factors might account for the decline. As noted above,
perhaps students are becoming less dependent on the school library for obtaining reading
material and information. Besides, lacking evidence to the contrary it is entirely possible that
library atmosphere is completely insignificant to most students.

Thirdly, the author assumes that improving atmosphere and comfort is necessary to reverse
the current trend. However, even if the surroundings go unchanged there might be other ways
to attract students to their library. Perhaps increasing the number of computer terminals or the
number of staff members would reverse the current trend. Or perhaps increasing the number
of books and periodicals, or enhancing their variety, would be effective. In short, without ruling
out all other possible means of achieving the desired results, the author cannot convince me
that the proposed course of action is necessary.

Finally, the author assumes that improving the library's atmosphere would suffice to increase
the frequency of student visits and the amount of reading on the part of students. Yet, the
author offers no evidence that these improvements alone would suffice. In fact, a more
comfortable library might actually discourage students from reading by creating a social rather
than work atmosphere.

In sum, the recommendation is not well supported. To strengthen the argument the author
must provide clear evidence that the school's students are in fact reading less and that if they
visit the school library more frequently they will read more. The author must also provide
evidence--perhaps by way of a student survey--that the library atmosphere is the chief
determinant of the frequency with which students visit the library. Finally, to better evaluate the
argument I would need to know what alternatives, if any, are available for increasing the
frequency with which students visit their library, and for increasing the amount that students
read.
