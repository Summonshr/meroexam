Argument 91
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a letter to the editor of the Parkville Daily Newspaper.*

**Throughout the country last year, as more and more children below the age of nine
participated in youth-league softball and soccer, over 80,000 of these young players suffered
injuries. When interviewed for a recent study, youth-league softball players in several major
cities also reported psychological pressure from coaches and parents to win games.

Furthermore, education experts say that long practice sessions for these sports take away
time that could be used for academic activities. Since the disadvantages apparently outweigh
any advantages, we in Parkville should discontinue organized athletic competition for children
under nine.**


This letter concludes that Parkville should not allow children under age nine to participate in
organized competitive sports. To support this conclusion, the author points out the increasing
number of children nationwide who become injured during athletic competitions. The author
also cites the fact that in some big dries children report undue pressure from coaches and
parents to win, and that long practice sessions take time away from a child's academic pursuits.

However, the author's argument relies on a series of unsubstantiated assumptions, and is
therefore unpersuasive as it stands.

One problem with the argument is that it assumes that the nationwide statistics about the
incidence of sports injuries among youngsters applies equally to Parkville's children. Yet this
might not be the case, for a variety of possible reasons. Perhaps Parkville maintains more
stringent safety standards than the national norm; or perhaps children's sporting events in
Parkville are better supervised by adults, or supervised by more adults. Without ruling out such
possibilities, the author cannot justifiably conclude that Parkville has a sports-injury problem to
begin with.

A second problem with the argument is that it unjustifiably assumes that in Parkville parents
and coaches unduly pressure youngsters to win organized athletic competitions. The only
evidence the author provides to substantiate this assumption are the reports from **big city**
children. We are not informed whether ParkviUe is a big city. Perhaps people who live in big
dries are generally more competitive than other people. If so, and if Parkville is not a big city,
then the author cannot justifiably rely on these reports to conclude that the proposed course of
action is necessary.

A third problem with the argument is that it unfairly assumes that children do not benefit
academically from participating in competitive sports. It is entirely possible that such sports
provide children with the sort of break from academics that helps them to be more productive
academically. It is also possible that the competitive drive that these sports might instill in
young children carries over to their academics and spurs them on to perform well in school.

Without considering such potential academic benefits, the author cannot reasonably conclude
that for young children the disadvantages of participating in athletic competition outweigh the
benefits.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To better evaluate the argument
we would need more information about the incidence of sports injuries among young children
in Parkville. To strengthen the argument the author must demonstrate that ParkviUe's parents
and coaches exert the kind of pressure on their children reported by **big city** children and, if
so, that this pressure in fact contributes to the sort of problems with which the author is
concerned.
