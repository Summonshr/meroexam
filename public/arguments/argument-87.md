Argument 87
---------------------------

**Humans arrived in the Kaliko Islands about 7,000 years ago, and within 3,000 years most of
the large mammal species that had lived in the forests of the Kaliko Islands had become
extinct. Yet humans cannot have been a factor in the species' extinctions, because there is no
evidence that the humans had any significant contact with the mammals. Further,
archaeologists have discovered numerous sites where the bones of fish had been discarded,
but they found no such areas containing the bones of large mammals, so the humans cannot
have hunted the mammals. Therefore, some climate change or other environmental factor
must have caused the species' extinctions.**

In this argument the speaker condudes that humans could not have been a factor in the
extinction of large mammal species in the Kaliko islands 3,000 years ago. To justify this
conclusion, the speaker points out that no evidence exists that humans hunted or had other
significant contact with these mammals. The speaker also points out that while archeologists
have found bones of discarded fish in the islands, they have not found any discarded mammal
bones there. For three reasons, this evidence lends little credibility to the speaker's argument.

First, the argument condudes too hastily that humans could not have had any significant
contact with these mammals. In relying on the lack of physical evidence such as bones, the
speaker overlooks the possibility that humans exported mammals--particularly their
bones--during this time period. Without ruling out this alternative explanation for the
disappearance of these species from the islands, the speaker cannot justify the conclusion
that humans were not a factor in their extinction from the islands.

Secondly, the argument relies on the assumption that without significant contact with these
other species humans could not have been a factor in their extinction. But the speaker
provides no evidence that this is the case. Moreover, perhaps humans drove these other
species away from their natural habitat not by significant contact but merely by intruding on
their territory. Or perhaps humans consumed the plants and animals on which these species
relied for their subsistence. Either scenario would explain how humans could have been a
factor in the extinction of these species despite a lack of significant contact.

Thirdly, the speaker assumes that the bones of fish that archeologists have found discarded
on the island were discarded by humans, and not by some other large mammal. However, the
speaker provides no evidence to substantiate this assumption. Given other possible
explanations for these discarded fish bones, this evidence in itself lends little credible support
to the speaker's theory about the extinction of large species of mammals.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it, the speaker must
rule out the possibility that humans exported the bones of these other species. To better
evaluate the argument, we would need more information about the diet of humans and of the
now-extinct mammals during that time period; particularly, we would need to know whether
those other mammals also fed on the fish whose discarded bones have been found on the
islands.
