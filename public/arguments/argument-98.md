Argument 98
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memorandum from the new president of the Patriot car
manufacturing company.*

**In the past, the body styles of Patriot cars have been old-fashioned, and our cars have not
sold as well as have our competitors' cars. But now, since many regions in this country report
rapid increases in the numbers of newly licensed drivers, we should be able to increase our
share of the market by selling cars to this growing population. Thus, we should discontinue our
oldest models and concentrate instead on manufacturing sporty cars. We can also improve the
success of our marketing campaigns by switching our advertising to the Youth Advertising
agency, which has successfully promoted the country's leading soft drink.**


In this memo the president of Patriot car manufacturing argues that in order to increase its
market share Patriot should
* discontinue its older models, which look **old- fashioned** and
have not been selling well,
* begin manufacturing sporty models, and
* hire Youth
Advertising agency, which has successfully promoted the country's leading soft drink. To justify
this recommendation the president points out that many regions report a rapid increase in the
number of newly licensed drivers. However, this argument relies on several dubious
assumptions, and is therefore unpersuasive.

To begin with, the president's argument relies on certain unproven assumptions about the
reports of a sharp increase in the number of newly licensed drivers. First, the argument
assumes that the reports are accurate, and that these regions account for a statistically
significant portion of Patriot's potential buyers. Secondly, the president overlooks the
possibility that in other regions that number is actually declining, so that there is no net
increase at all.

Even assuming that the reports are accurate and the regions cited are representative of the
overall territory in which Patriot cars are marketed, the president concludes too hastily that
newly licensed drivers will tend to favor new cars over used ones, and to favor Patriot's sporty
new cars over other manufacturers' new vehicles. The president ignores the likelihood that the
vast majority of new drivers are teenagers who cannot afford new sports cars, or new cars of
any kind. Even teenagers who can afford new sports cars might prefer other manufacturers'
cars--perhaps due to Patriot's old-fashioned image. Lacking evidence that new drivers who
buy cars will tend to buy Patriot sports cars, the president cannot convince me that the
recommended course of action will increase Patriot's market share.

Finally, the fact that Youth has successfully promoted the country's leading soft drink
amounts to scant evidence that Youth would also be successful in promoting Patriot cars.

Marketers that are effective in one industry are not necessarily effective in another. Besides,
the president unfairly assumes that Patriot's current advertising agency is partly responsible
for Patriot's relatively small market share. Perhaps some other factor--such as poor
management, distribution, or pricing decisions--is the true reason for Patriot's market-share
problem. Moreover, perhaps Youth would be less effective than Patriot's current ad agency.

Thus switching to Youth will not necessarily improve Patriot's market share--and might even
result in a decline in that share.

In sum, the president's recommendation is weak. To strengthen it the president must show
that the reports are a reliable indicator of the overall change in the number of newly licensed
drivers. The president must also provide dear evidence--perhaps by way of a reliable
survey--that a sufficient percentage and number of new drivers who are able and willing to buy
new cars will choose Patriot's sports cars over other manufacturers' cars, so that Patriot's
overall market share will increase. To better assess the recommendation that Patriot switch to
Youth, I would need to know the extent to which Patriot's current ad strategy is responsible for
Patriot's market-share problems; then I would need to know Youth's experience and success
record in the car industry--relative to that of Patriot's current agency as well as other available
agencies.
