Argument 54
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a local newspaper.*

**People should not be misled by the advertising competition between Coldex and Cold-Away,
both popular over-the-counter cold medications that anyone can purchase without a doctor's
prescription. Each brand is accusing the other of causing some well-known, unwanted side
effect: Coldex is known to contribute to existing high blood pressure and Cold-Away is known
to cause drowsiness. But the choice should be clear for most health-conscious people:
Cold-Away has been on the market for much longer and is used by more hospitals than is
Coldex. Clearly, Cold-Away is more effective.**


This argument concludes that Cold-Away is a more effective non-prescription cold
medication than Coldex. The argument points out that each one has a distinct unwanted side
effect: Cold-Away causes drowsiness, while Coldex contributes to existing high blood pressure.

To support its conclusion, the argument points out that Cold-Away has been on the market
considerably longer, and that it is used by more hospitals than Coldex. I find the argument
unconvincing for three reasons.

First, the mere fact that Cold-Away has been on the market longer than Coldex is scant
evidence of their comparative effectiveness. Well-established products are not necessarily
better than newer ones. Moreover, in my observation newer medicines often make use of
newer pharmaceutical developments than competing products; thus it can be argued that
since Cold-Away has been on the market longer than Coldex it is likely to be less, not more,
effective than Coldex.

Secondly, the argument unfairly assumes that hospitals prefer Cold-Away because of its
comparative effectiveness as a cold medication. It is entirely possible that hospitals do not
consider drowsiness an undesirable side effect for their patients. For that matter, perhaps
hospitals use Cold-Away primarily for this effect rather than as a cold medication.

A third problem with the argument involves Coldex's side effect: high blood pressure.

Admittedly, people who already have a serious blood pressure problem would probably be well
advised to use Cold-Away instead. However, only those people are susceptible to this side
effect. Thus for all other people the vast majority of cold-medicine users--Coldex's side effect
is irrelevant in choosing between the two products. Moreover, if a person without high blood
pressure wishes to avoid drowsiness, Coldex would seem to be the preferable medication.

In sum, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it, the argument's
proponent must provide dear evidence that hospitals prefer Cold-Away because of its
effectiveness in treating colds. To better assess the argument, I would need better evidence
comparing the effectiveness of the two products--perhaps through clinical studies or reliable
surveys of the general population.
