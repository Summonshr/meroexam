Argument 101
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a letter to the Grandview City Council from a local business leader.*

**During last year's severe drought, when the water supply in the Grandview city reservoir fell to
an extremely low level, the city council imposed much more rigid water-rationing rules. But just
after these rules were imposed, industrial growth in the area declined. This clearly shows that
the new rationing rules have hurt industry in Grandview. Therefore, to promote the health of
the local economy, the city council should now stop water rationing.**


In this letter a Grandview City business leader concludes that in order to promote economic
health the city must abolish the water-rationing rules it implemented during last year's drought.

To support this conclusion the letter's author points out that since the city implemented these
rules industrial growth in the area has declined. However, this argument contains several
logical problems, which render it unconvincing as it stands.

First of all, the argument relies on two threshold assumptions: that people who use the city's
water have complied with the rules, and that area industry is subject to the rules in the first
place. Yet the author supplies no evidence to substantiate either assumption. In other words, if
area industries have not in fact been rationing water, the author's condusion that water
rationing is a contributing cause of the recent decline in industry growth would be indefensible.

A second problem with the argument is that it overlooks other possible explanations for the
decline in industry growth. Perhaps the decline is the result of a general economic recession
that has also impacted businesses in areas not subject to water rationing. Or perhaps local or
state regulations unrelated to water rationing are instead responsible for the slowdown.

Without accounting for such possibilities, the author cannot justify the conclusion that the
water rationing is the cause of the slowdown.

A third problem with the argument is that it unjustifiably assumes that stopping water rationing
would help reverse the decline in industry growth. It is entirely possible that this course of
action would actually exacerbate the decline. Specifically, perhaps the lack of water has been
the primary factor in the slowdown. If so, and if the rationing stops, water might become even
more scarce depending on current drought conditions, in which case the slowdown would
worsen.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the business
leader must provide strong evidence that no other factors were responsible for the slow down
in industry growth, and that industry has complied with the rules in the first place. Finally, to
better evaluate the argument we would need more information about current water availability
in the area, so that we can assess how stopping water rationing would affect this availability.
