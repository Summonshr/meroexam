Argument 25
---------------------------

*The following appeared as part of a memo from the president of Automate, a company that
manufactures automobiles.*

**It has come to my attention that Sparks, Inc., the manufacturing company that just moved into
our state, is advertising job openings at salaries that are twice as high as those paid to our
experienced assembly-line workers. Some of our employees have already left to work for
Sparks. In order to keep our best staff, we must pay them salaries equal to those Sparks pays
its employees. Otherwise we will continue to lose employees in the future, because Sparks
must staff the additional new plants that it plans to build in the state.**


In this memo the president of Automate, an automobile manufacturer, concludes that to
retain its best employees Automate must offer them salaries equal to those that Sparks
automobile manufacturing pays its employees. To justify this conclusion the president points
out that Sparks has just moved into the state and is now advertising job openings with salaries
twice as high as those Automate pays its assembly-line workers, and that some Automate
employees have already defected to Sparks. As further support for the argument, the president
notes that Sparks plans to build additional plants in the state and will need to staff those plants.

I find the argument unconvincing on several grounds.

First, the memo does not indicate what kinds of jobs Sparks is now advertising--the ones for
which salaries are to be twice those paid to Automate's assembly-line workers. Those jobs
might be top management positions or other jobs for which salaries are often significantly
higher than those for assembly-line work. If so, this fact would serve to refute the president's
assumption that Sparks is paying higher s~lades than Automate for similar work.

Secondly, the president assumes that the reason why some Automate workers have
defected to Sparks is that Sparks has offered them higher salaries. Yet, the president fails to
provide evidence to substantiate this assumption. Lacking such evidence, those defectors
might have gone to work for Sparks because the city where Sparks is located is a preferable
place to live, or because Sparks offers other job incentives that Automate does not.

And, if the defectors accepted jobs at Sparks before Sparks began offering higher salaries,
then salary could not have been a factor in their decision to defect to Sparks. In short, until the
president establishes a clear causal relationship between the advertised salaries and the
defection of some Automate employees to Sparks, the president cannot reasonably conclude
that Automate must increase its salaries in order to prevent additional employees from
defecting to Sparks in the future.

Thirdly, even assuming that those defectors did leave Automate because Sparks offered
higher salaries for similar work, the president's argument rests on the additional assumptions
that the number of defectors is significant and that these defectors are valuable to Automate.

Yet the president fails to substantiate either assumption. Perhaps only a very small percentage
of Automate's worker's have defected; if so, the president's proposed salary increases might
amount to an overreaction. Or, perhaps the defectors were among Automate's least valuable
employees; for that matter, perhaps Automate's most valuable employees are the ones who
are most loyal and would not leave Automate even if they were offered a higher salary
elsewhere. Without substantiating both assumptions, the president cannot reasonably
conclude that Automate must raise the salaries of its best workers in order to retain them.

Finally, the mere fact that Sparks plans to build additional new plants in the state amounts to
scant evidence that Automate will continue to lose valuable employees unless it raises their
salaries. Perhaps Sparks plans to staff those new plants with workers from its other plants, or
from other sources besides Automate. Or, perhaps Sparks is advertising high salaries now
simply to gain a foothold into the state's labor market, and that once Sparks is established in
the state it will offer lower salaries for new jobs. Besides, Sparks' plan to build additional plants
might amount to sheer speculation, in which case the president's proposed salary increases
would seem hasty.

In sum, the president's recommendation seems ill-conceived, at least lacking additional
supporting evidence. To bolster the argument the president must provide clear evidence that a
significant percentage of Automate's valuable employees have defected to Sparks because
Sparks offered them higher salaries for similar work rather than for some other reason. The
president must also provide better evidence that this is a trend that is likely to continue and to
harm Automate's operations unless Automate boosts the salaries of its best employees to
match the salaries Sparks would pay those employees.
