Argument 61
---------------------------

*The following is a memorandum issued by the publisher of a newsmagazine, Newsbeat, in the
country of Dinn.*

**Our poorest-selling magazine issues over the past three years were those that featured
international news stories on their front covers. Over the same period, competing
news-magazines have significantly decreased the number of cover stories that they devote to
international news. Moreover, the cost of maintaining our foreign bureaus to report on
international news is increasing. Therefore, we should decrease our emphasis on international
news and refrain from displaying such stories on our magazine covers.**


In this memo the publisher of the magazine Ne~vsbeat claims that to maximize sales the
magazine should decrease its emphasis on international news and refrain from displaying
such stories on its covers. To support this condusion the publisher points out that the
magazine's poorest-seUing issues during the last three years have been those with cover
stories about international events, and that during this same period the number of international
cover stories appearing in other news magazines has decreased. On several grounds, this
evidence lends little credible support for the memo's conclusion.

First of ail, the fact that the magazine's poorest-selling issues were the ones with
international cover stories might be explained by a variety of factors. Perhaps international
events themselves were not as interesting during those periods. If so, it might be a mistake to
refrain from emphasizing international events when those events are interesting enough to
stimulate sales. Or perhaps the news magazine business is seasonal, or cyclical, and those
particular issues would have sold more poorly regardless of the cover story. In short, without
ruling out other possible explanations for the relatively poor sales of those particular issues the
publisher cannot justifiably condude that international cover stories were the cause of the
relatively poor sales.

Secondly, the memo fails to indicate whether other magazines experienced an increase or a
decrease in sales by reducing their emphasis on international news. It is possible, for instance,
that the other magazines experienced declining sales even for issues focusing only on
domestic news. If so, then the publisher's recommendation would make little sense. On the
other hand, if other magazines experienced the same correlation between cover story and
sales volume, this fact would lend considerable support to the publisher's conclusion that
international cover stories were responsible for poor sales.

Thirdly, the memo cites increasing costs of maintaining international news bureaus as an
additional reason to de-emphasize international news. While this fact does lend support to the
publisher's suggestion, the publisher overlooks the possibility that if other news magazines
de-emphasize international coverage due to increasing bureau costs, NeuJsbeat might turn
out to be the only magazine covering international news, which in turn might actually stimulate
sales. It would be hasty to implement the publisher's suggestion without acknowledging and
exploring this possible scenario.

In conclusion, the memo is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen the argument, the
publisher must show that it was the international covers of Ne~vsbeat, and not some other
factor, that were responsible for the relatively poor sales of issues with those covers. To better
assess the publisher's recommendation that Nev.,sbeat should de-emphasize international
news, we would need to know what changes in sales volume other news magazines
experienced by de-emphasizing international news. We would also need more information
about the impact that increasing bureau costs will have on magazines presently competing
with Newsbeat in the area of international news.
