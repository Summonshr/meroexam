Argument 121
---------------------------

*The following appeared in a memorandum from the president of Mira Vista College to the
college's board of trustees.*

**At nearby Green Mountain College, which has more business courses and more job
counselors than does Mira Vista College, 90 percent of last year's graduating seniors had job
offers from prospective employers. But at Mira Vista College last year, only 70 percent of the
seniors who informed the placement office that they would be seeking employment had found
full-time jobs within three months after graduation, and only half of these graduates were
employed in their major field of study. To help Mira Vista's graduates find employment, we
must offer more courses in business and computer technology and hire additional job
counselors to help students with their resum√©s and interviewing skills.**


This letter recommends that in order to improve its job placement record Mira Vista College
should offer more business and computer courses and should hire more job counselors. To
support this recommendation the author points out that at Green Mountain College 90 percent
of last year's graduates had job offers, but that only 70 percent of Mira Vista seniors who
reported that they planned to seek employment had jobs within three months after graduation,
and only half of these graduates were employed in their major fields of study. This argument is
problematic in several critical respects.

First, the author assumes that Green Mountain's comparatively strong job-placement record
is due to the fact that it provides more business courses and job counselors than Mira Vista,
rather than some other factor. But this need not be the case. Perhaps Green Mountain
students are exceptionally bright or resourceful to begin with. Or perhaps the quality of
instruction and job counseling at Green Mountain is exceptionally high. Moreover, perhaps
Green Mountain provides more business courses and job counselors than Mira Vista simply
because Green Mountain is a larger school with more students; if so, then the comparative
numbers are not likely to have any bearing on job-placement success. In short, without ruling
out other possible explanations for the difference between job-placement rates, the author
cannot reasonably conclude that additional business courses and job counselors would
enhance Mira Vista's job-placement record.

Another problem with the argument is that the statistics comparing job placement rates
might be distorted in one or more respects. First, the author fails to indicate the percentage of
Green Mountain graduates who find employment in their major fields of study. Without this
information it is impossible to assess the comparative success of the two colleges in helping
their recent graduates find such employment. Second, the author ignores the possibility that
the time parameters defining the two schools' job-placement rates differ. Mira Vista's record
was determined only three months after graduation. It is entirely possible that Green
Mountain's record was based on a longer period of fi_me, thereby distorting the comparative
success of the schools in helping their recent graduates find jobs.

The cited statistics about Mira Vista's job placement record might be unreliable in other
respects as well. These statistics were based only on data from Mira Vista seniors who
reported to the college's job-placement center. The author overlooks the possibility that only a
small portion of Mira Vista seniors reported to begin with. The author also ignores the
possibility that many of these reporting students later changed their minds about seeking
employment or were offered jobs but turned them down. Without ruling out these possible
scenarios, the author cannot reasonably rely on these statistics to support the claim that Mira
Vista's job-placement record is comparatively poor and thus could be improved by Mira Vista's
emulating Green Mountain.

In conclusion, the argument is unconvincing as it stands. To strengthen it the author must
show that additional business courses and job counselors would in fact improve Mira Vista's
job-placement rate, and that the comparison between the job-placement rates at the two
schools is fair. Finally, the author provides no evidence whatsoever to support his
recommendation for providing more computer courses; to justify this claim the author must
provide supporting evidence.
